Injury and Illness Prevention Programs
An injury and illness prevention program,1 is a proactive process to
help employers find and fix workplace hazards before workers are
hurt. We know these programs can be effective at reducing injuries,
illnesses, and fatalities. Many workplaces have already adopted
such approaches, for example as part of OSHA’s cooperative
programs — such as the Voluntary Protection Programs. Not only
do these employers experience dramatic decreases in workplace
injuries, but they often report a transformed workplace culture
that can lead to higher productivity and quality, reduced turnover,
reduced costs, and greater employee satisfaction.
Based on the positive experience of employers with existing
programs, OSHA believes that injury and illness prevention
programs provide the foundation for breakthrough changes in
the way employers identify and control hazards, leading to a
significantly improved workplace health and safety environment.
Adoption of an injury and illness prevention program will result in
workers suffering fewer injuries, illnesses and fatalities. In addition,
employers will improve their compliance with existing regulations,
and will experience many of the financial benefits of a safer and
healthier workplace cited in published studies and reports by
individual companies, including significant reductions in workers’
compensation premiums.
Thirty-four states and many nations around the world already
require or encourage employers to implement such programs. The
key elements common to all of these programs are management
leadership, worker participation, hazard identification and
assessment, hazard prevention and control, education and training,
and program evaluation and improvement.

The occupational safety and health community uses various names to describe
systematic approaches to reducing injuries and illnesses in the workplace.
Consensus and international standards use the term Occupational Health and Safety
Management Systems; OSHA currently uses the term Injury and Illness Prevention
Programs and others use Safety and Health Programs to describe these types of
systems. Regardless of the title, they all systematically address workplace safety and
health hazards on an ongoing basis to reduce the extent and severity of work-related
injuries and illnesses.

10 • OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION

Most successful injury and illness prevention programs include
a similar set of commonsense elements that focus on finding
hazards in the workplace and developing a plan for preventing and
controlling those hazards. Each of these key elements are important
in ensuring the success of the overall program, and the elements
are interrelated and interdependent. In other words, they must be
used together to create a system of prevention and control. The
elements recommended by OSHA are:
•

Management Leadership: Management demonstrates their
commitment to improve safety and health, establishes goals and
objectives, and provides adequate resources and support.

•

Employee Participation: Management actively involves
employees in the program — for example, identifying and
reporting hazards and investigating incidents. Employees are
encouraged to communicate openly with management and
report safety and health concerns.

•

Hazard Identification and Assessment: Processes and
procedures are put in place to continually identify and assess
workplace hazards and evaluate risks.

•

Hazard Prevention and Control: Processes and procedures are
created and implemented to control workplace hazards.

•

Education and Training: All workers are provided with education
or training to carry out their part under the program. In addition,
all workers are trained in a language and manner they can
understand to recognize workplace hazards and trained in the
control measures needed to protect themselves and other
workers from these hazards.

•

Program Evaluation and Improvement: Processes are established
to monitor the program performance, verify implementation,
and identify deficiencies and opportunities for improvement.
Employers take necessary actions to improve the program.

Several government agencies and consensus standards
organizations have guidance for injury and illness prevention
programs. OSHA issued voluntary safety and health program
management guidelines in 1989 that encourage the systematic
identification, evaluation, and prevention or control of general
workplace hazards and the hazards of specific jobs and tasks.
GENERAL INDUSTRY DIGEST • 11

More recently, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
issued ANSI Z10-2005, Occupational Health and Safety Management
Systems. This voluntary consensus standard provides critical
management system requirements and guidelines for improvement
of occupational health and safety. The British Standards Institution
also recently issued OHSAS 18001, an Occupational Health and
Safety Assessment Series for health and safety management
systems. OHSAS 18001 is an international occupational health
and safety management system specification intended to help
organizations control occupational health and safety risks.
Further information on injury and illness prevention programs can be
found on OSHA’s website at www.osha.gov/dsg/topics/safetyhealth.

General Industry Standards
General Duty Clause
(Pub. Law 91-596 Section 5(a)(1))
Hazardous conditions or practices not covered in an OSHA
standard may be covered under Section 5(a)(1) of the Occupational
Safety and Health Act (OSH Act), which states: “Each employer
must furnish to each of his employees employment and a place
of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are
causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his
employees.”

Fatality, Injury and Illness Information
Recording and Reporting Occupational Fatalities,
Injuries and Illnesses
As of January 1, 2015, employers must notify the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) within 8 hours of a
workplace fatality or within 24 hours of any work-related inpatient
hospitalization, amputation or loss of an eye. This includes fatalities
that occur during work, as a result of a work-related heart attack.
The report of such incidents must be given orally (via telephone
or in person) to the OSHA area office (or state plan office) that is
nearest to the site of the incident (§1904.39(a)). Employers may
also use OSHA’s toll-free telephone number, 1-800-321-OSHA (6742)
when reporting work-related incidents. Please note that some state
plans have fatality/catastrophe reporting requirements that may be
more stringent than the Federal requirements stated above.
Employers with more than ten employees and whose
establishments are not classified as a partially exempt industry
must report serious work-related injuries and illnesses using OSHA
Forms 300, 300A and 301 (§1904). OSHA Forms 300, 300A and 301
are available at www.osha.gov/recordkeeping/RKforms.html.

14 • OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION

Employers who are required to keep Form 300, the Injury and
Illness log, must post Form 300A, the Summary of Work-Related
Injuries and Illnesses, in the workplace every year from February 1
to April 30 (§1904.32(b)(6)). Current and former employees, or their
representatives, have the right to access injury and illness records
(§1904.35(b)(2)). Employers must give the requester a copy of the
relevant record(s) by the end of the next business day (§1904.35(b)(2)).
Partially exempt industries include establishments in specific low
hazard retail, service, finance, insurance or real estate industries
and are listed in Appendix A to Subpart B (§1904.2(a)(1)). The list
is also available online at www.osha.gov/recordkeeping/ppt1/
RK1exempttable.html.

Walking-Working Surfaces
Aisles and Passageways
Where mechanical handling equipment is used, sufficient safe
clearances must be allowed for aisles, at loading docks, through
doorways, and wherever turns or passage must be made. Aisles
and passageways must be kept clear and in good repair, with
no obstruction across or in aisles that could create a hazard
(§1910.22(b)(1) and §1910.176(a)).
Permanent aisles and passageways must be appropriately marked
(§1910.22(b)(2) and §1910.176(a)).
Covers and/or guardrails must be provided to protect personnel
from the hazards of open pits, tanks, vats, ditches, etc. (§1910.22(c)).

rooms must be kept clean and orderly and in a sanitary condition
(§1910.22(a)(1)).
The floor of every workroom must be maintained in a clean and,
so far as possible, a dry condition. Where wet processes are used,
drainage must be maintained, and false floors, platforms, mats, or
other dry standing places should be provided where practicable
(§1910.22(a)(2)).
To facilitate cleaning, every floor, working place, and passageway
must be kept free from protruding nails, splinters, holes, or loose
boards (§1910.22(a)(3)).

Floor Loading Limit
In every building or other structure, or part thereof, used for
mercantile, business, industrial, or storage purposes, the loads
approved by the building official must be marked on plates of
approved design that must be supplied and securely affixed
by the owner of the building, or his duly authorized agent, in a
conspicuous place in each space to which they relate. Such plates
must not be removed or defaced but, if lost, removed, or defaced,
must be replaced by the owner or his agent (§1910.22(d)(1)).

Guarding Openings and Holes
Every stairway and ladderway floor opening must be guarded by
standard railings with standard toeboards on all exposed sides
except at the entrance. For infrequently used stairways, the guard
may consist of a hinged cover and removable standard railings.
The entrance to ladderway openings must be guarded to prevent a
person from walking directly into the opening (§§1910.23(a)(1) and
(a)(2)).
Every hatchway and chute floor opening must be guarded by a
hinged floor opening cover equipped with standard railings that
leave only one exposed side or a removable railing with toeboard
on not more than two sides and a fixed standard railing with
toeboards on all other exposed sides (§1910.23(a)(3)).
16 • OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION

Every floor hole into which persons can accidentally walk must be
guarded by either a standard railing with standard toeboard on all
exposed sides, or a floor hole cover that should be hinged in place.
While the cover is not in place, the floor hole must be attended or
must be protected by a removable standard railing (§1910.23(a)(8)).
Every open-sided floor, platform or runway that is 4 feet (1.2 meters)
or more above adjacent floor or ground level must be guarded by
a standard railing with toeboard on all open sides, except where
there is an entrance to a ramp, stairway, or fixed ladder. Runways
not less than 18 inches (45 centimeters) wide used exclusively for
special purposes may have the railing on one side omitted where
operating conditions necessitate (§§1910.23(c)(1) and (c)(2)).
Regardless of height, open-sided floors, walkways, platforms,
or runways above or adjacent to dangerous equipment must be
guarded with a standard railing and toeboard (§1910.23(c)(3)).

Housekeeping
All places of employment, passageways, storerooms, and service
rooms must be kept clean and orderly and in a sanitary condition.
The floor of every workroom shall be maintained in a clean and,
so far as possible, dry condition. Where wet processes are used,
drainage shall be maintained and false floors, platforms, mats or
other dry standing places should be provided where practicable or
appropriate waterproof footgear shall be provided (§§1910.22(a)(1),
(a)(2) and §1910.141(a)(3)).

Fixed Ladders
All rungs must have a minimum diameter of 3/4 inch (1.8
centimeters), if metal, or 1 1/8 inches (2.8 centimeters), if wood.
They must be a minimum of 16 inches (40 centimeters) wide
and should be spaced uniformly no more than 12 inches (30
centimeters) apart (§§1910.27(b)(1)(i) through (iii)).
Further, rungs, cleats, and steps of individual rung ladders must be
designed so that workers’ feet cannot slide off their end. All ladders
must be free of splinters, sharp edges, burrs, or projections which
may be a hazard (§§1910.27(b)(1)(iv) and (b)(1)(v)).
GENERAL INDUSTRY DIGEST • 17

Cages, wells, or ladder safety devices must be provided on all fixed
ladders more than 20 feet (6 meters) long to a maximum unbroken
length of 30 feet. A landing platform must be provided for each
30 feet (9 meters) of length. Where no cage is provided, landing
platform intervals must be reduced to a maximum of 20 feet (6
meters) (§§1910.27(d)(1), (d)(2), and (d)(5)). Cages on fixed ladders
must extend 42 inches (1 meter) above the top of the landing,
unless other acceptable protection is provided, and the bottom of
the cage must be not less than 7 feet (2.1 meters) nor more than
8 feet (2.4 meters) above the base of the ladder, with the bottom
flared not less than 4 inches, or the portion of the cage opposite the
ladder must be carried to the base (§§1910.27(d)(1)(iii) and (iv)).
The side rails of through- or side-step ladder extensions must
extend 3 1/2 feet (1 meter) above parapets and landings. For
through-ladder extensions, the rungs must be omitted from the
extension and must have not less than 18 inches (45.7 centimeters)
nor more than 24 inches (61 centimeters) clearance between rails.
For side-step or offset fixed ladder sections, at landings, the side
rails and rungs must be carried to the next regular rung beyond or
above the 3 1/2 feet (1 meter) minimum (§1910.27(d)(3)).

Portable Ladders
Stepladders must be equipped with a metal spreader or locking
device of sufficient size and strength to securely hold the front and
back sections in an open position. The spreader must have all sharp
points covered or removed to protect the user (§1910.25(c)(2)(i)(f)
and §1910.26(a)(3)(viii)).
Ladders must be inspected frequently and those that have
developed defects must be withdrawn from service for repair or
destruction and tagged or marked as “Dangerous, Do Not Use”
(§1910.25(d)(1)(x) and §1910.26(c)(2)(vii)).
Non-self-supporting ladders must be erected on a sound base with
the base of the ladder a distance from the wall or upper support
equal to one quarter the length of the ladder and placed to prevent
slipping. Where the potential exists for slipping, the ladder must be
lashed, or held in position. Ladders must not be used in a horizontal
position as platforms, runways, or scaffolds (§§1910.25(d)(2)(i)
through (iii) and §§1910.26(c)(3)(i) and (iii)).
18 • OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION

The top of a ladder used to gain access to a roof must extend at
least 3 feet (0.9 meters) above the point of contact (support), at
eave, gutter, or roofline (§1910.25(d)(2)(xv)).
Portable ladders must have nonconductive siderails if they are used
where the employee or the ladder could contact exposed energized
parts (§1910.333(c)(7)).

Railings
A standard railing must consist of a top rail, intermediate rail, and
posts, and must have a vertical height of 42 inches (1.05 meters)
from the upper surface of the top rail to the floor, platform, runway,
or ramp level. The top rail must be smooth-surfaced throughout the
length of the railing. The intermediate rail must be approximately
halfway between the top rail and the floor, platform, runway, or
ramp. The ends of the rails must not overhang the terminal posts
except where such overhang does not constitute a projection
hazard (§1910.23(e)(1)).
A railing for open-sided floors, platforms, and runways must have
a toeboard whenever persons can pass beneath the open sides,
there is moving machinery, or there is equipment with which falling
materials could cause a hazard (§1910.23(c)(1)).
Railings must be of such construction that the complete structure
must be capable of withstanding a load of at least 200 pounds
(90 kilograms) applied in any direction at any point on the top rail
(§1910.23(e)(3)(iv)).
A stair railing must be of construction similar to a standard
railing, but the vertical height must be no more than 34 inches
(85 centimeters) nor less than 30 inches (75 centimeters) from the
upper surface of the top rail to the surface of tread in line with the
face of the riser at the forward edge of the tread (§1910.23(e)(2)).

Toeboards
Railings protecting floor openings, platforms, and scaffolds must
be equipped with toeboards whenever persons can pass beneath
the open side, wherever there is moving machinery, or wherever
there is equipment with which falling material could cause a hazard
(§1910.23(c)(1)).
GENERAL INDUSTRY DIGEST • 19

A standard toeboard must be at least 4 inches (10 centimeters) in
height and may be of any substantial material, either solid or open,
with openings not to exceed 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) in greatest
dimension (§1910.23(e)(4)).

Scaffolds
All scaffolds and their components must be capable of supporting,
without failure, at least four times the maximum intended load
(§1910.28(a)(4)).
All planking must be Scaffold Grade, as recognized by grading rules
for the species of wood used. The maximum permissible spans for
2-inch (5 centimeters) x 9-inch (22.5 centimeters) or wider planks
are shown in the following table:

The maximum permissible span for 1 1/4-inch (3.12 centimeters) x
9-inch (22.5 centimeters) or wider plank for full thickness is 4 feet
(1.2 meters), with medium loading of 50 pounds (22.5 kilograms)
per square foot (§1910.28(a)(9)).
Scaffold planks must extend over their end supports not less than
6 inches (15 centimeters) nor more than 18 inches (45 centimeters)
(§1910.28(a)(13)).
Scaffold planking must be overlapped a minimum of 12 inches (30
centimeters) or secured from movement (§1910.28(a)(11)).

Skylights
Every skylight floor opening and hole must be guarded by a
standard skylight screen or a fixed standard railing on all exposed
sides (§1910.23(a)(4)).

20 • OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION

Fixed Industrial Stairs
Every flight of stairs having four or more risers must be provided
with a standard railing on all open sides. Handrails must be
provided on at least one side of closed stairways, preferably on
the right side descending. Where stairways have one side open,
at least one stair railing must be provided on the open side, and
where both sides of the stairwell are open, one stair railing on each
side must be installed (§1910.23(d)(1) and §1910.24(h)). Stairs must
be constructed so that the riser height and tread width are uniform
throughout (§1910.24(f)). In addition, fixed stairways must have a
minimum width of 22 inches (55.9 centimeters) (§1910.24(d)).
Fixed stairways must be provided for access from one structure
level to another where operations necessitate regular travel between
levels, and for access to operating platforms at any equipment which
requires attention routinely during operations. Fixed stairs must also
be provided where access to elevations is daily or at each shift where
such work may expose employees to acids, caustics, gases or other
harmful substances, or for which purposes the carrying of tools or
equipment by hand is normally required. Spiral stairways must not
be permitted except for special limited usage and secondary access
situations where it is not practical to provide a conventional stairway.
Winding stairways may be installed on tanks and similar round
structures where the diameter of the structure is not less than 5 feet
(1.5 meters) (§1910.24(b)).

Means of Egress
Emergency Action Plans
Wherever any given OSHA standard requires an emergency action
plan to ensure employee safety in the event of fire and other
emergencies, such action plan must be prepared in writing, kept in
the workplace, and reviewed with affected employees. However,
employers with 10 or fewer employees may communicate the plan
orally to employees. The plan must include the following elements:
escape procedures and routes, critical plant operations, employee
accounting following an emergency evacuation, rescue and
medical duties, means of reporting emergencies, and persons to be
contacted for information or clarification (§1910.38).

with exit routes sufficient to permit the prompt escape of occupants
in case of emergency (§1910.36(b)). An exit door must be unlocked
(§1910.36(d)).
In hazardous areas, or where employees may be endangered by the
blocking of any single means of egress due to fire or smoke, there
must be at least two means of egress that are remote from each
other (§§1910.36(b)(1) and (b)(2)).
Exits and the way of approach and travel from exits must be
maintained so that they are unobstructed and are accessible at all
times (§1910.37(a)(3)). In addition, employees must be able to open
exit doors from the inside at all times without keys, tools, or special
knowledge (§1910.36(d)). All exits must discharge directly to the
street or other open space that gives safe access to a public way
(§1910.36(c)(1)).
Exit doors serving more than 50 people, or at high-hazard areas,
must swing in the direction of exit travel (§1910.36(e)(2)).
Exits must be marked by readily visible, suitably illuminated exit
signs. Exit signs must be distinctive in color and provide contrast
with surroundings. The word “EXIT” must be in plainly legible
letters, not less than 6 inches (15 centimeters) high (§1910.37).
The capacity of exit routes must be sufficient to handle the
occupant load and meet the minimum height (7.5 feet (2.3 m)) and
width (28 inches (71.1 cm)) requirements. Any projections from the
ceiling must not reach a point of less than 6.66 feet (2.0 m) from the
floor (§§1910.36(f) and (g)). Any door, passage, or stairway that is
neither an exit nor a way of exit access and that is so located
or arranged as to be likely to be mistaken for an exit must be
identified by a sign reading “Not an Exit” or similar designation
(§1910.37(b)(5)).
An employer demonstrating compliance with the exit-route
provisions of NFPA 101, Life Safety Code, 2009 edition, or the exitroute provisions of the International Fire Code, 2009 edition, would
be deemed in compliance with the corresponding requirements in
§§1910.34, 1910.36, and 1910.37 (§1910.35).

Occupational Health and Environmental Controls
Nonionizing Radiation (Electromagnetic Radiation)
Nonionizing radiation (electromagnetic radiation) applies to all
radiations originating from radio stations, radar equipment, and
other possible sources of electromagnetic radiation such as those
used for communication, radio navigation, and industrial and
scientific purposes (§§1910.97(a)(1)(i) and (a)(4)).
For normal environmental conditions and for incident
electromagnetic energy of frequencies from 10 MHz to 100 GHz,
employers must ensure that the radiation level not exceed 10 mW/
cm2 (milliwatt per square centimeter) as averaged over any possible
0.1-hour period without careful consideration of the reasons for
doing so. A radiation level of 10 mW/cm2 (milliwatt per square
centimeter) as averaged over any possible 0.1-hour period means
that there exists a power density of 10 mW/cm2 for periods of 0.1hour or more, and an energy density of 1 mW-hr./cm2 (milliwatt
hour per square centimeter) during any 0.1-hour period (§1910.97(a)
(2)(i)).
It is important for employers to be responsible for and implement
proper controls to prevent any employee from being exposed to
electromagnetic radiation in excess of the acceptable limits, as it
has been shown that some parts of the human body (e.g., eyes,
testicles) may be harmed if exposed to incident radiation levels
significantly in excess of the recommended levels (§1910.97(a)(2)(ii)).
Each electromagnetic radiation area must be conspicuously posted
with appropriate signs and/or barriers (§1910.97(a)(3)).

Noise Exposure
When workers are exposed to a time-weighted average noise level
of 85 dBA or higher over an 8-hour work shift, employers must
implement a Hearing Conservation Program. Hearing Conservation
Programs require employers to measure noise levels, provide free
annual hearing exams and free hearing protection, provide training,
and conduct evaluations of the adequacy of the hearing protectors
in use (§§1910.95(c) and (d)(1)).

GENERAL INDUSTRY DIGEST • 23

When workers are exposed to sound levels exceeding those shown
in Table G-16 (below), employers must use feasible engineering
and/or administrative controls to protect workers. When
engineering or administrative controls fail to reduce the noise level
to within the levels in Table G-16, personal protective equipment
must be provided and used to reduce the noise to an acceptable
level (§§1910.95(a) and (b)(1)).
The employer must make available to affected employees or their
representatives copies of this standard, as well as post a copy in the
workplace (§1910.95)(l)(1)).

When the daily noise exposure is composed of two or more periods of noise
exposure of different levels, their combined effect should be considered, rather
than the individual effect of each. If the sum of the following fractions: C(1)/T(1) +
C(2)/T(2) C(n)/T(n) exceeds unity, then, the mixed exposure should be considered to
exceed the limit value (Cn indicates the total time of exposure at a specified noise
level, and Tn indicates the total time of exposure permitted at that level). Exposure to
impulsive or impact noise should not exceed 140 dB peak sound pressure level.

24 • OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION

Local/Exhaust Ventilation
Blast-cleaning enclosures must be exhaust ventilated in such a
way that a continuous inward flow of air will be maintained at all
openings in the enclosure during blasting operations. The rate
of exhaust must be sufficient to provide prompt clearance of the
dust-laden air within the enclosure after the cessation of blasting.
All air inlets and access openings must be baffled or so arranged
that by the combination of inward air flow and baffling the escape
of abrasive or dust particles into an adjacent work area will be
minimized and visible spurts of dust will not be observed. Following
blasting operations, the blast must be turned off and the exhaust
system must be run for a sufficient period of time to remove the
dusty air within the enclosure before the enclosure can be opened
(§1910.94(a)(3)).
The construction, installation, inspection, and maintenance of
exhaust ventilation systems must conform to the principles
and requirements set forth in American National Standard
Fundamentals Governing the Design and Operation of Local
Exhaust Systems, Z9.2-1960, and ANSI Z33.1-1961 (§1910.94(a)(4)(i)).
When dust leaks are noted, repairs must be made as soon as
possible (§1910.94(a)(4)(i)(a)). The static pressure drop at the
exhaust ducts leading from the equipment must be checked at
initial installation and periodically thereafter to assure continued
satisfactory operation. Whenever an appreciable change in the
pressure drop indicates a partial blockage, the system must be
cleaned and returned to normal operating condition (§1910.94(a)(4)
(i)(b)).
In installations where the abrasive is recirculated, the exhaust
ventilation system for the blasting enclosure must not be relied
upon for the removal of fines from the spent abrasive instead of an
abrasive separator. An abrasive separator must be provided for this
purpose (§1910.94(a)(4)(ii)).
The air exhausted from blast-cleaning equipment must be
discharged through dust collecting equipment. Dust collectors
must be set up so that the accumulated dust can be emptied and
removed without contaminating other working areas (§1910.94(a)
(4)(iii)).
GENERAL INDUSTRY DIGEST • 25

Spray booths or spray rooms are to be used to enclose or confine
all spray finishing operations (§§1910.94(c)(2) and (c)(3)). The total
air volume exhausted through a spray booth must be such as to
dilute the solvent vapor to at least 25 percent of the lower explosive
limit of the solvent being sprayed (§1910.94(c)(6)(ii)).
Spray booths must be constructed of steel, securely and rigidly
supported, or of concrete or masonry except that aluminum
or other substantial noncombustible material may be used for
intermittent or low volume spraying. Spray booths must be
designed to sweep air currents toward the exhaust outlet. The
interior surfaces of spray booths must be smooth and continuous
without edges and otherwise designed to prevent pocketing
of residues and facilitate cleaning and washing without injury.
The floor surface of a spray booth and operator’s working area,
if combustible, must be covered with noncombustible material
of such character as to facilitate the safe cleaning and removal
of residues. Distribution or baffle plates, if installed to promote
an even flow of air through the booth or cause the deposit
of overspray before it enters the exhaust duct, must be of
noncombustible material and readily removable or accessible on
both sides for cleaning. Such plates must not be located in exhaust
ducts (§1910.94(c)(3)(i)(a) and §1910.107(b)(1) through (b)(4)).
Exhaust systems for grinding, polishing, and buffing operations
should be designed and tested in accord with American Standard
Fundamentals Governing the Design and Operation of Local
Exhaust Systems, Z9.2-1960 (§1910.94(b)(4)(ii)).

Sanitation
Change Rooms
Whenever employees are required to wear protective clothing due
to possible contamination with toxic materials, employers must
provide employees with a change room. The change room must
be equipped with storage facilities for street clothes and separate
storage facilities for the protective clothing (§1910.141(e)).
Drinking Water
Potable drinking water must be provided in all places of
employment (§1910.141(b)(1)(i)). Potable drinking water dispensers
26 • OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION

must be designed, constructed, and serviced to ensure sanitary
conditions and must be capable of being closed, and have a tap
(§1910.141(b)(1)(iii)). Open containers such as barrels, pails or
tanks for drinking water from which the water must be dipped or
poured, whether or not they are fitted with a cover, are prohibited
(§1910.141(b)(1)(v)). A common drinking cup is not allowed
(§1910.141(b)(1)(vi)).
Eating and Drinking Areas
Employers must not allow workers to consume food or beverages
in toilet rooms or in any area exposed to a toxic material
(§1910.141(g)(2)). A covered receptacle of corrosion-resistant or
disposable material must be provided in designated eating and
drinking areas for the disposal of waste food. Receptacles must be
provided with a solid tight-fitting cover, unless sanitary conditions
can be maintained without the use of a cover (§1910.141(g)(3)).
Showers
Where showers are required to be provided, one shower must be
provided for every 10 employees of each sex, or numerical fraction
thereof, who are required to shower during the same shift; body
soap or other appropriate cleansing agents must be provided in
a convenient location to the showers; hot and cold water feeding
a common discharge line must be provided; and individual clean
towels must be made available (§§1910.141(d)(3)(i) through (v)).
Toilets
Toilet facilities must be provided according to the following: 1-15
persons, one facility; 16-35 persons, two facilities; 36-55 persons,
three facilities; 56-80 persons, four facilities; 81-110 persons, five
facilities; 111-150 persons, six facilities; over 150 persons, one for
each additional 40 persons. Where toilet rooms will be occupied
by no more than one person at a time and can be locked from
the inside, separate rooms for each sex need not be provided
(§1910.141(c)(1)(i)). However, these requirements do not apply to
mobile crews or to normally unattended work locations so long
as employees working at these locations have transportation
immediately available to nearby toilet facilities (§1910.141(c)(1)(ii)).
Each water closet must occupy a separate compartment with a door
and walls or partitions between fixtures sufficiently high to ensure
privacy (§1910.141(c)(2)).
GENERAL INDUSTRY DIGEST • 27

Wash basins (lavatories), with hot and cold, or tepid running water,
hand soap or equivalent, and hand towels, blowers or equivalent,
must be provided in every place of employment (§§1910.141(d)(2)(i)
through (iv)).

Confined Spaces
Permit-Required Confined Spaces
The employer must evaluate the workplace to determine if confined
space conditions exist that necessitate permits for entry. A decision
flow chart3 is contained in Appendix A to section 1910.146 of the
OSHA Permit-Required Confined Space standard to facilitate
compliance with this requirement (§1910.146(c)(1)).
If permit-required confined spaces exist, the employer must inform
exposed workers, by posting danger signs or by any other equally
effective means, of the existence and location of and the danger
posed by the permit spaces (§1910.146(c)(2)).
If the employer decides that employees will not enter permit
spaces, the employer must take effective measures to prevent them
from entering the permit spaces and must comply with additional
requirements of the standard (§1910.146(c)(3)).
If confined space entry is required, a written permit program must
be developed and initiated by the employer. The written program
must be available for inspection by employees and their authorized
representatives (§1910.146(c)(4)).
Before entry is authorized, the employer must develop and
implement the means, procedures, and practices necessary for
safe entry operations, which includes, but is not limited to, the
following: specifying acceptable entry conditions; providing each
authorized entrant or that employee’s authorized representative
with the opportunity to observe any monitoring or testing of permit
spaces; isolating the permit space; purging, inerting, flushing, or
ventilating the permit space as necessary to eliminate or control
atmospheric hazards; providing pedestrian, vehicle, or other
barriers as necessary to protect entrants from external hazards;
Appendix A provides information and non-mandatory guidelines to assist
employers and employees in complying with the appropriate requirements.

28 • OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION

and verifying that conditions in the permit space are acceptable for
entry throughout the duration of an authorized entry (§§1910.146(d)
(3) and (e)(1)).
The employer must provide training so that all employees whose
work is regulated by the permit entry system section acquire
the understanding, knowledge, and skills necessary for the safe
performance of the duties assigned by the standard (§1910.146(g)(1)).
The employer must ensure that each designated member of
the rescue and emergency service team is provided with, and is
trained to use properly, the personal protective equipment (PPE)
and rescue equipment necessary for making rescues from permit
spaces (§§1910.146(k)(2) and (k)(2)(i)). The necessary PPE must be
provided at no cost to the employee (§1910.132(h)). The employer
must also evaluate each prospective rescuers’ ability to respond
to a rescue summons in a timely manner, considering the hazards
involved (§1910.146(k)(1)(i)).

Control of Hazardous Energy (Lockout/Tagout)
The Control of Hazardous Energy covers the servicing and
maintenance of machines and equipment in which the unexpected
start-up or energization of the machines or equipment, or release
of stored energy could cause injury to employees (§1910.147(a)
(1)(i)). In order to prevent injury to employees, each employer is
required to establish a program and utilize procedures for affixing
appropriate lockout or tagout devices to energy isolating devices,
and to otherwise disable the machines or equipment to prevent
the unexpected start-up, energization, or release of stored energy
(§1910.147(a)(3)(i)).
The program and procedures discussed above must also include
employee training for those involved in the servicing of machines
or equipment, and periodic inspections that must be conducted
at least annually to ensure the continued effectiveness of the
program (§1910.147(c)(1)). The periodic inspection must include a
review of the procedures with all employees who are authorized to
use the procedures when lockout is used, and with all authorized
and affected employees when tagout is used (§1910.147(c)(6)(i)).
When outside contractors are performing servicing or maintenance
GENERAL INDUSTRY DIGEST • 29

within a plant or facility, each employer must coordinate with the
other employers to ensure that no employees are endangered
(§1910.147(f)(2)(i)). When a group of employees are performing a
servicing or maintenance activity, each employee must be afforded
protection equivalent to the utilization of individual lockout or
tagout (§1910.147(f)(3)(i)). When servicing or maintenance extends
over more than one shift, specific procedures must be utilized to
ensure continuity of personnel protection, including provision for
the orderly transfer of lockout or tagout control (§1910.147(f)(4)).
If an energy isolating device is capable of being locked out, the
employer’s energy control program must utilize lockout, unless the
employer can demonstrate that the utilization of a tagout system
will provide full employee protection as set forth in §1910.147(c)
(3) (§1910.147(c)(2)(iii)). Further, after January 2, 1990, whenever
replacement or major repair, renovation or modification of a
machine or equipment is performed, and whenever new machines
or equipment are installed, energy isolating devices for such
machine or equipment must be designed to accept a lockout device
(§1910.147(c)(2)(iii)).
If an energy isolating device is not capable of being locked out, the
employer’s energy control program must utilize a tagout system
(§1910.147(c)(2)(i)). Further, in demonstrating that a level of safety
is achieved in the tagout program that is equivalent to the level of
safety obtained by using a lockout program, the employer must
demonstrate full compliance with all tagout-related provisions
of §1910.147 together with such additional elements as are
necessary to provide the equivalent safety available from the use
of a lockout device. Additional means to be considered as part of
the demonstration of full employee protection must include the
implementation of additional safety measures such as the removal
of an isolating circuit element, blocking of a controlling switch,
opening of an extra disconnecting device, or the removal of a
valve handle to reduce the likelihood of inadvertent energization
(§1910.147(c)(3)(ii)). This requirement to implement an additional
safety measure is often referred to as “tags-plus”.

must be used only as production tanks for storage of crude
petroleum in oil-producing areas (§1910.106(b)(1)(iii)(a)(3)).

Note: Atmospheric tanks built according to Underwriters’
Laboratories, Inc., must be limited to 2.5 p.s.i.g. under emergency
venting conditions (§1910.106(b)(1)(iv)(c)).

Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response
Any information concerning the chemical, physical, and
toxicological properties of each substance known or expected to be
present on site that is available to the employer and relevant to the
duties an employee is expected to perform must be made available
to the affected employees prior to the commencement of their work
activities. The employer may utilize information developed for the
hazard communication standard for this purpose (§1910.120(c)(8)).
Training is required for all employees who work at hazardous
waste cleanup sites, treatment storage and disposal (TSD) sites
(Environmental Protection Agency permitted sites), and who
respond to any emergencies involving hazardous substances.
Training must cover the necessary information to perform these

36 • OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION

jobs safely including information on the proper personal protective
equipment and procedures to safeguard employees against hazards
and effects of exposure to toxic substances (§§1910.120(e), (p)(7),
and (q)(6)). The level of training is broken into five positions that
include: first responder awareness, first responder operations,
hazardous materials technician, hazardous materials specialist, and
the on-scene incident commander (§§1910.120(q)(6)(i) through (v)).
A safety and health program that details the responsibilities and
methods for assuring employee safety is necessary for employees
engaged in hazardous waste cleanup and for TSD activities
(§§1910.120(b)(1) and (p)(1)).
Medical surveillance (physical examination) is required for
employees who are or maybe exposed to hazardous substances
or health hazards, or who wear respirators for 30 or more days
per year, or who develop signs or symptoms possibly related to
workplace exposure (§1910.120(f)(2)).
Personal protective equipment must be selected and used to
protect employees from hazardous substances and physical
hazards (§1910.120(g)(3)(i)).
When necessary, a decontamination procedure must be used
to assure that hazardous substances are removed from workers
before they leave the worksite as well as from equipment that is to
be taken off site (§§1910.120(k)(1) and (2), (p)(4), and (q)(2)(vii)).
When hazardous waste cleanup or removal operations commence
on a site and the duration of the work will require six months or
greater time to complete, the employer must provide showers,
including change rooms, for all employees exposed to hazardous
substances and health hazards involved in hazardous waste cleanup
or removal operations (§1910.120(n)(7)).
Showers must be located in areas where exposures are below
the permissible exposure limits and published exposure levels. If
this cannot be accomplished, then a ventilation system must be
provided that will supply air that is below the permissible exposure
limits and published exposure levels (§1910.120(n)(7)(iii)). The
employer must ensure that employees shower at the end of their
work shift (§1910.120(n)(7)(iv)).

GENERAL INDUSTRY DIGEST • 37

An emergency response plan must be developed and implemented
to handle anticipated emergencies prior to the commencement
of emergency response operations. The plan must be in writing
and be available for inspection and copying by employees, their
representatives, and OSHA personnel (§1910.120(q)(1)).

Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals
Employers with highly hazardous chemicals must develop and
implement a process safety management system that complies
with the elements of §1910.119.
Employers must develop a written plan of action regarding
employee participation and must consult with employees and
their representatives on the conduct and development of process
hazards analyses and on the development of the other elements of
process safety management (§§1910.119(c)(1) and (2)).
The employer must complete a compilation of written process
safety information before conducting any process hazard analysis.
The compilation of written process safety information is to enable
the employer and the employees involved in operating the
process to identify and understand the hazards posed by those
processes involving highly hazardous chemicals. This process
safety information must include information pertaining to the
hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals used or produced by the
process, information pertaining to the technology of the process,
and information pertaining to the equipment in the process
(§1910.119(d)). The employer must perform a process hazard
analysis (hazard evaluation) appropriate to the complexity of the
company’s processes and must identify, evaluate, and control the
hazards involved in the process (§1910.119(e)(1)).
The employer must develop and implement written operating
procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting
activities involved in each covered process consistent with the
process safety information (§1910.119(f)(1)). The employer must
develop and implement safe work practices to provide for the
control of hazards during operations such as lockout/tagout;
confined space entry; opening process equipment or piping; and
control over entrance into a facility by maintenance, contractor,
laboratory, or other support personnel (§1910.119(f)(4)).
38 • OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION

Each employee presently involved in operating a process, and each
employee before being involved in operating a newly-assigned
process, must be trained in an overview of the process and in the
operating procedures as specified in the Operating Procedures
section of the standard. The training must include emphasis on the
specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations including
shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to the employee’s job
tasks (§1910.119(g)(1)).
Contract employers must assure that each contract employee is
trained and understands the work practices necessary to safely
perform his/her job and the hazards of the process (§§1910.119(h)(3)
(i) and (ii)).
The employer, when selecting a contractor, must obtain and
evaluate information regarding the contract employer’s safety
performance and programs and inform contract employees
of process hazards and the facility emergency action plan
(§§1910.119(h)(2)(i) through (iii)).
The employer must perform a pre-startup safety review for
new facilities and for modified facilities when the modification
is significant enough to require a change in the process safety
information (§1910.119(i)(1)).
Employers must issue a hot work permit for any hot work operations
conducted on or near a covered process (§1910.119(k)(1)).
The employer must establish and implement written procedures to
maintain the ongoing integrity of process equipment (§1910.119(j)(2)).
The employer must establish and implement written procedures to
manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, and
procedures, and changes to facilities that affect a covered process
(§1910.119(l)(1)).
The employer must investigate each incident which resulted in, or
could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of highly
hazardous chemicals in the workplace (§1910.119(m)(1)).
The employer must establish and implement an emergency action
plan for the entire plant in accord with the provisions of §1910.38(a)
(§1910.119(n)).

GENERAL INDUSTRY DIGEST • 39

Employers must also certify, at least every 3 years, that they have
evaluated compliance with the provisions of the OSHA Process
Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals standard
(§§1910.119(n) and (o)(1)).

Spray-Finishing Operations
Conventional dry type spray booths equipped with overspray dry
filters or filter rolls must conform to the following specifications:
•

•

•

•

•
•
•

The spraying operations, except electrostatic spraying
operations must ensure an average air velocity over the open
face of the booth of not less than 100 feet (30 meters) per
minute;
Electrostatic spraying operations may be conducted with an
air velocity over the open face of the booth of not less than
60 feet (18 meters) per minute, depending on the volume of
the finishing material being applied and its flammability and
explosion characteristics;
Visible gauges, or audible alarm or pressure activated devices,
must be installed to indicate or ensure that the required air
velocity is maintained;
Filter rolls must be inspected after each period of use and
clogged filter pads discarded and replaced. Filter pads must be
inspected to ensure proper replacement of filter media;
Spray booths must be so installed that all portions are readily
accessible for cleaning;
A clear space of not less than 3 feet (0.9 meters) on all sides
must be kept from storage or combustible construction; and
Space within the spray booth on the downstream and upstream
sides of filters must be protected with approved automatic
sprinklers (§1910.107(b)).

There must be no open flame or spark-producing equipment in
any spraying area, nor within 20 feet (6 meters) thereof, unless
separated by a partition (§1910.107(c)(2)).
Electrical wiring and equipment not subject to deposits of
combustible residues but located in a spraying area must be of
an explosion-proof type approved for Class I, group D locations
(§1910.107(c)(6)).
40 • OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION

The quantity of flammable or combustible liquids kept in the
vicinity of spraying operations must be the minimum required for
operations and should ordinarily not exceed a supply for one day
or one shift. Bulk storage of portable containers with flammable or
combustible liquids must be in a separate, constructed building
detached from other important buildings or cut off in a standard
manner (§1910.107(e)(2)).
Whenever flammable or combustible liquids are transferred from
one container to another, both containers must be effectively
bonded and grounded to prevent discharge of sparks of static
electricity (§1910.107(e)(9)).
All spraying areas must be kept as free from the accumulation
of deposits of combustible residues as practical, with cleaning
conducted daily if necessary. Scrapers, spuds, or other such tools
used for cleaning purposes must be of nonsparking material
(§1910.107(g)(2)).
Residue scrapings and debris contaminated with residue must be
immediately removed from the premises and properly disposed
of. Approved metal waste cans must be provided wherever rags or
waste are impregnated with finishing material and all such rags or
waste deposited therein immediately after use. The contents of waste
cans must be properly disposed of at least once daily or at the end
of each shift (§1910.107(g)(3)). “No smoking” signs in large letters on
a contrasting color background must be conspicuously posted in all
spraying areas and paint storage rooms (§1910.107(g)(7)).

Hazardous Agents
Air Contaminants
Section 1910.1000 contains more than 600 permissible exposure
limits (PEL). Tables Z-1, Z-2, and Z-3 list these PELs in alphabetical
order. To achieve compliance with this section when air
concentrations exceed the PEL, administrative or engineering
controls must first be determined and implemented whenever
feasible. When such controls are not feasible to achieve full
compliance, protective equipment or any other protective measures

GENERAL INDUSTRY DIGEST • 41

must be used to keep the exposure of employees to air contaminants
within the limits prescribed in §1910.1000(e). In addition, whenever
respirators are used, they must comply with §1910.134.

Asbestos
Employers must ensure that no employee is exposed to an airborne
concentration of asbestos above the excursion limit. Specifically,
asbestos exposure must not be in excess of 0.1 fiber per cubic
centimeter of air (0.1 f/cc) as an 8-hour time-weighted average
(TWA) (§1910.1001(c)(1)), and 1.0 f/cc over a period of 30 minutes
(§1910.1001(c)(2)).
A determination of each employee’s exposure must be made from
breathing zone air samples that are representative of full-shift,
8-hour TWA, and 30-minute short-term exposures associated with
operations that are most likely to produce exposures above the
excursion limit for each shift (§§1910.1001(d)(1)(i) and (ii)).
Employers must conduct periodic monitoring for employees
exposed above the action level, 8-hour TWA, or 30-minute excursion
limit (§1910.1001(d)(3)).
Wherever the airborne concentration of asbestos and/or presumed
asbestos-containing material (PACM) exceeds the TWA, employers
must establish regulated areas that are demarcated from the
rest of the workplace in a manner that minimizes the number of
persons exposed to asbestos (§§1910.1001(e)(1) and (2)). Access
to the regulated areas must be limited to authorized persons that
are supplied with and using an appropriate respirator, selected in
accord with §1910.1001(g)(2) (§§1910.1001(e)(3) and (4)).
Employers must institute engineering and work practice controls
to reduce and maintain employee exposure at or below the TWA
and the excursion limit, except to the extent that such controls are
not feasible (§1910.1001(f)(1)(i)). Asbestos must be handled, mixed,
applied, removed, cut, scored, or otherwise worked in a wet state.
Wet methods, enclosed processes, or ventilated areas must be used
when products containing asbestos are removed from bags, cartons,
or containers (§§1910.1001(f)(1)(vi) and (viii)). Sanding of asbestoscontaining flooring material is prohibited (§1910.1001(f)(1)(x)).
42 • OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION

Respirators must be used: (1) while feasible engineering and work
practice controls are being installed or implemented; (2) during
maintenance and repair activities, or other activities where
engineering and work practice controls are not feasible; (3) where
feasible engineering and work-practice controls are not yet sufficient
to reduce employee exposure to or below the TWA and/or excursion
limit; and (4) in emergencies (§§1910.1001(g)(1)(i) through (iv)).
Employers and owners of buildings constructed prior to 1980
which contain thermal system insulation or sprayed-on or
troweled-on surfacing material must presume that these materials
contain asbestos, or else conduct sampling and analysis to verify
that the materials do not contain more than 1 percent asbestos
(§§1910.1001(j)(1) and (2)). Building and facility owners must inform
employers of employees, and employers must inform employees
who will perform housekeeping activities in areas which contain
asbestos-containing materials (ACM) and/or PACM of the presence
and location of ACM and/or PACM in such areas which may be
contacted during such activities (§1910.1001(j)(2)(iii)).
Employers must train each employee who is exposed to airborne
concentrations of asbestos at or above the PEL and/or excursion
limit. The employer must institute a training program and ensure
employee participation in the program (§1910.1001(j)(7)(i)).
Employers must institute a medical surveillance program for all
employees who are or will be exposed to airborne concentrations
of fibers of asbestos at or above the TWA and/or excursion limit
(§1910.1001(l)(1)(i)).
Employers must maintain accurate records required to comply with
the provisions of the standard, including air monitoring, objective
data, training and medical surveillance (§1910.1001(m)).

Bloodborne Pathogens
Each employer having employee(s) who may incur skin, eye,
mucous membrane, mouth, or parenteral contact with blood or
other potentially infectious materials as a result of performing their
professional duties must establish a written Exposure Control Plan
designed to eliminate or minimize exposure (§1910.1030(c)(1)(i)).
GENERAL INDUSTRY DIGEST • 43

Employers required to establish an Exposure Control Plan must
solicit input from non-managerial employees who are potentially
exposed to injuries from contaminated sharps on the identification,
evaluation, and selection of effective engineering and work practice
controls, and must document such solicitation in the Exposure
Control Plan (§1910.1030(c)(1)(v)).
Universal precautions must be observed to prevent contact with
blood or other potentially infectious materials. The concept of
Universal Precautions requires that all human blood and certain
human body fluids are treated as if known to be infectious for
HIV, HBV, and other bloodborne pathogens (§1910.1030(b)). Under
circumstances in which differentiation between body fluid types
is difficult or impossible, all body fluids must be considered
potentially infectious materials (§1910.1030(d)(1)). This includes
first-aid workers and other emergency care providers who might be
exposed to bleeding victims.
Engineering and work practice controls (e.g., sharps disposal
containers, self-sheathing needles, safer medical devices, such as
sharps with engineered sharps injury protections and needleless
systems) must be used to eliminate or minimize employee
exposure. Where occupational exposure remains after instituting
these controls, personal protective equipment must also be
used (§1910.1030(d)(2)(i)). All engineering controls used must be
examined and maintained, or replaced on a regular schedule to
ensure their effectiveness (§1910.1030(d)(2)(ii)).
In addition to the above methods, vaccinations provide an important
role in exposure control. The hepatitis B vaccine and vaccination
series must be offered to all workers, at no cost, who have a
reasonably anticipated exposure to blood or other potentially
infectious materials (§1910.1030(f)). The vaccine is given in a series of
three injections over a 6-month period and all three injections must
be received. Healthcare workers and healthcare providers who do
not wish to be vaccinated must sign a declination form.
Employers must establish and maintain a sharps injury log to
record percutaneous (through the skin) injuries from contaminated
sharps (§1910.1030(h)(5)).

44 • OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION

Benzene
Employee exposure to gaseous and liquid benzene must be limited
to one (1) part per million (ppm) as an 8-hour time-weighted
average (TWA), known as the permissible exposure limit (PEL),
and five (5) ppm as averaged over a period of fifteen (15) minutes,
known as the short-term exposure limit (STEL) (§§1910.1028(c)(1)
and (2)).
A determination of each employee’s exposure must be made from
breathing zone air samples that are representative of full-shift,
8-hour TWA, and 15-minute short-term exposures associated with
operations that are most likely to produce exposures above the
STEL for each shift (§§1910.1028(e)(1)(i) through (iii)). The employer
must conduct periodic monitoring for employees exposed above
the action level, PEL, or STEL (§§1910.1028(e)(3)(i), (ii), and (iv)). The
employer must also monitor for employee exposure when there
may be new or additional exposures (§1910.1028(e)(5)(i)).
The employer must institute engineering and work practice controls
to reduce and maintain employee exposure at or below the PEL
(§§1910.1028(f)(1)(i) and (ii)).
Employers must provide each employee with an appropriate
respirator that must be used when engineering and work practice
controls are infeasible or insufficient to reduce employee exposure
to permissible levels (§1910.1028(g)(1)). When employees could
have eye or skin contact with liquid benzene, the employer must
also select and provide appropriate protective clothing or other
equipment (§1910.1028(h)).
The employer must institute a medical surveillance program for
employees who are or may be exposed to benzene at or above
the PEL and other thresholds for certain numbers of days annually
(§1910.1028(i)(1)(i)). The employer must make available medical
examinations and consultations, including certain laboratory tests,
to each covered employee before initial assignment, at least annually,
and in certain other situations (§1910.1028(i)(2)(i)). Employees
required to use respirators must also be provided pulmonary
function tests every three years (§1910.1028(i)(3)(iii)).

GENERAL INDUSTRY DIGEST • 45

A medical exam following exposure in an emergency situation
may require special elements or actions, including a urinary
phenol test, blood tests, and physician’s referral to a hematologist/
internist for further evaluation or treatment (§§1910.1028(i)(4) and
(5)). Employers must implement a medical removal plan, including
medical removal protection benefits, for employees referred to a
hematologist/internist (§§1910.1028(i)(8) and (9)).
The employer must establish a regulated area wherever exposures
to concentrations of benzene may exceed or reasonably be expected
to exceed the PEL or STEL (§1910.1028(d)(1)). Regulated areas must
be determined in a manner that minimizes the number of employees
within the regulated area and access must be limited to authorized
persons (§§1910.1028(d)(2), (d)(3), and (j)(1)(i)). Labels or other
appropriate forms of warning must be provided for containers of
benzene (§1910.1028(j)(1)(ii)).
Employers must also provide employees with information and
training on benzene at the time of initial assignment and, for
employees who may be exposed at or above the action level, at
least annually thereafter (§1910.1028(j)(3)(i)).
The employer must establish and maintain an accurate record of
initial monitoring data or objective data relied upon in place of
certain initial monitoring provisions and a record for each employee
subject to medical surveillance requirements (§§1910.1028(k)(1)(i)
and (k)(2)(i)).

1,3-Butadiene
The standard establishes permissible exposure limits (PELs) of 1
part per million (ppm) as an 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA)
and 5 ppm as a 15-minute short-term exposure limit (STEL) for
1,3-butadine (BD) (§§1910.1051(c)(1) and (2)).
Employee exposures to BD must be determined from breathing
zone air samples that are representative of the 8-hour TWA and
15-minute STEL associated with operations most likely to produce
exposures exceeding the STEL for each shift and job classification
(§§1910.1051(d)(1)(i) through (iii)). Employers must conduct periodic
monitoring for employees exposed above the action level (0.5
ppm as a TWA), PEL, or STEL (§§1910.1051(d)(3)(i) through (iii)).
46 • OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION

Additional monitoring is required when there has been a change
in production, process, control equipment, personnel, or work
practices and if a spill, leak, or rupture has occurred (§§1910.1051(d)
(5)(i) and (ii)).
Employers must institute engineering and work practice controls
(excluding employee rotation) to reduce and maintain employee
exposure at or below the TWA and the STEL (§§1910.1051(f)(1)(i)
through (ii) and (f)(2)(iv)).
For operations and jobs in which exposures exceed the action level,
employers must establish an exposure goal program to reduce
exposures (§1910.1051(g)(1)).
Employers must provide each employee with an appropriate
respirator that must be used when engineering and work practice
controls do not reduce employee exposures to permissible levels
(§§1910.1051(f)(1)(ii) and (h)(1)(i) through (iv)). Employers must
comply with requirements of the respiratory protection program
and for respiratory protection (§§1910.1051(h)(2)(i) through (vi) and
(h)(3)(i) through (iii)). When appropriate for limiting skin and eye
contact, employers must provide appropriate protective clothing
and equipment, including eye and face protection that meet the
requirements of §1910.33 (§1910.1051(i)).
Employers must provide medical screening and surveillance to
employees with BD exposures at or above the action level for 30 or
more days and employees who are or may be exposed at or above
PELs for 10 or more days a year (§1910.1051(k)(1)(i)). Employers
must continue providing medical surveillance and screening
for employees who were exposed to BD for 10 or more years at
concentrations exceeding the PELs for 30 or more days or the action
level for 60 or more days a year, in addition to employees exposed
to above 10 ppm on 30 or more days in any year and exposed
during an emergency (§§1910.1051(k)(1)(ii) and (iii)). Frequency of
medical surveillance and screening varies according to exposure
scenarios (§§1910.1051(k)(3)(i) through (iii)). Information from
medical screening must be aggregated and periodically reviewed to
assess the health of the employee population (§1910.1051(k)(8)(i)).
The standard also contains requirements for regulated areas,
emergency plans, hazard communication, and recordkeeping
(§§1910.1051(e), (j), (l), and (m)).
GENERAL INDUSTRY DIGEST • 47

Cadmium
Employee exposure to cadmium must be limited to the permissible
exposure limit (PEL) of 5 micrograms per cubic meter of air (µg/m3)
as an 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA) (§1910.1027(c)).
Employee exposure to cadmium must be determined from
breathing zone air samples that represent the 8-hour TWA for
employees expected to have the highest exposure for each shift
and job classification (§§1910.1027(d)(1)(ii) and (iii)). Employers
must conduct periodic monitoring for employees exposed above
the action level (2.5 µg/m3 TWA) (§1910.1027(d)(3)(i)). Additional
monitoring is required when there has been a change that could
result in further exposures (§1910.1027(d)(4)).
Employers must establish engineering and work practice controls
(excluding employee rotation) to reduce and maintain employee
exposure at or below the PEL for most industries (§1910.1027(f)
(1)(i)). For six industries (nickel-cadmium battery, zinc/cadmium
refining, lead smelting, pigment manufacture, plating, and
stabilizers), the employer must use engineering and work
practice controls to limit employee exposures to the appropriate
separate engineering control air limit (SECAL) of 15 or 50 µg/m3
(§1910.1027(f)(1)(ii)).
Employers must demonstrate the effectiveness of ventilation
systems, use a high-efficiency filter if air is recirculated, and
minimize employee exposure during ventilation system
maintenance (§§1910.1027(f)(3)(i) through (iv)).
Employers must provide each employee with an appropriate
respirator that must be used when engineering and work
practice controls do not reduce employee exposure to the PEL or
appropriate SECAL (§§1910.1027(f)(1)(iv), (g)(1), (g)(1)(i) through
(iv), and (vi)). Employers must comply with requirements of the
respiratory protection program and respirator selection sections
(§§1910.1027(g)(2) and (3)).
If employees are exposed to cadmium above the PEL or could
experience skin or eye irritation, employers must provide
appropriate protective clothing and equipment and provide for its
cleaning, disposal, and repair (§§1910.1027(i)(1), (i)(1)(i) through (iii),
and (i)(3)(i) through (iv)). Employers must also require employees
48 • OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION

to remove contaminated clothing in change rooms and place the
clothing in sealable containers that are labeled with warnings
(§§1910.1027(i)(2)(i) through (iv)).
Employers must provide medical surveillance to employees who
are exposed at or above the action level for 30 or more days per
year, were previously exposed at or above the action level for a
total of more than 60 months before this standard became effective,
or are exposed in an emergency (§§1910.1027(l)(1)(i)(A), (B), and
(l)(7)(i)). Surveillance includes measurement of blood and urinary
cadmium and urinary β-2-microglobulin levels, and results of those
analysis could affect frequency of periodic medical surveillance
or trigger actions such as assessment of controls or removal from
exposure (§§1910.1027(l)(2) through (I)(5)). Employees may see a
second or third physician if the employer picks the initial physician
(§§1910.1027(l)(13)(i) and (iv)).
Employers must remove employees from cadmium exposure for
up to 18 months when a physician determines that medical removal
is required for any reason such as cadmium and β-2-microglobulin
levels in blood and/or urine, inability to wear a respirator, or
evidence of cadmium-related illness (§§1910.1027(l)(11)(i)(A), (C),
and (l)(12)(i)). During medical removal, employers must maintain
the employee’s earnings, seniority and other employment rights
and benefits (§1910.1027(l)(12)(ii)).
The standard also has requirements for regulated areas,
emergencies, hygiene areas and practices, housekeeping, hazard
communication, recordkeeping, and observation of monitoring
(§§1910.1027(e), (h), and (j) through (o)).

Chromium (VI)
Employee exposure to chromium (VI) must be limited to an airborne
concentration of 5 parts chromium (VI) per cubic meter of air (5 µg/m3)
as an 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA) (§1910.1026(c)).
Employers must determine each employee’s initial 8-hour TWA
exposure to chromium (VI) through breathing zone air samples
for each shift, each job classification, and each work area
(§1910.1026(d)(2)(i)). Employers must conduct periodic monitoring
for employees exposed above the action level or the TWA and
GENERAL INDUSTRY DIGEST • 49

additional monitoring when necessary (§§1910.1026(d)(2)(iii), (iv),
and (vi)). Exposure may be determined through a performance
approach, rather than monitoring (§1910.1026(d)(3)). Employees
have the right to observe monitoring and must be notified of results
(§§1910.1026(d)(4)(i) and (d)(6)(i)).
Employers must establish a regulated area wherever exposures
to airborne concentrations of chromium (VI) may exceed the TWA
(§1910.1026(e)(1)). Regulated areas must be demarcated and access
must be limited to authorized persons (§§1910.1026(e)(2) and (3)).
Employers must institute engineering and work practice controls to
reduce and maintain employee exposure at or below the TWA or at
or below 25 µg/m3 in certain aerospace industries (§§1910.1026(f)
(1)(i) and (ii)). Employers are not permitted to rotate employees to
comply with permissible exposure limits (§1910.1026(f)(2)).
Employers must provide each employee with an appropriate
respirator that must be used when engineering and work practice
controls are infeasible or insufficient to reduce employee exposure
to permissible levels and must implement a respiratory protection
program (§§1910.1026(f)(1)(i), (g)(1)(iii), and (g)(2)). When employees
could have chromium (VI)-induced skin or eye irritation, employers
must also provide appropriate personal protective clothing and

(TWA) and five (5) ppm as averaged over a period of fifteen (15)
minutes (excursion limit) (§§1910.1047(c)(1) and (2)).
A determination of each employee’s exposure must be made from
breathing zone air samples that are representative of full-shift,
8-hour TWA, and 15-minute short-term exposures associated with
operations that are most likely to produce exposures above the
excursion limit for each shift (§§1910.1047(d)(1)(i) through (ii)).

to reduce and maintain employee exposure at or below the TWA
and the excursion limit (§§1910.1047(f)(1)(i) and (ii)).
Employers must provide each employee with an appropriate
respirator that must be used when engineering and work
practice controls are infeasible or insufficient to reduce employee
exposure to permissible levels (§§1910.1047(f)(1)(ii) and (g)(1)).
When employees could have eye or skin contact with EtO or EtO
solutions, the employer must also select and provide appropriate
protective clothing or other equipment (§1910.1047(g)(4)).
A written plan for emergency situations must be developed for
each workplace where there is a possibility of an emergency,
and the plan must be implemented in the event of an emergency
(§1910.1047(h)(1)(i)). The plan must cover respiratory protection
for employees engaged in correcting emergency conditions,
emergency action procedures, and fire prevention elements
(§§1910.1047(h)(1)(ii) and (iii)).

action level, without regard to the use of respirators, for at least
GENERAL INDUSTRY DIGEST • 51

30 days a year (§1910.1047(i)(1)(i)(A)). The employer must make
available medical examinations and consultations to each covered
employee at least annually and in other situations such as when
employees develop signs or symptoms that might be related to
exposure or when employees are exposed during an emergency
(§§1910.1047(i)(1)(i) and (i)(2)(i)).
The employer must establish a regulated area wherever exposures
to airborne concentrations of EtO may exceed the TWA or can
reasonably be expected to exceed the excursion limit (§1910.1047(e)
(1)). Regulated areas must be demarcated in any manner that
minimizes the number of employees within the regulated area and
access must be limited to authorized persons (§§1910.1047(e)(2), (e)

or insufficient to reduce employee exposure to permissible
levels, such as during maintenance activities or vessel cleaning,
employers must provide employees with an appropriate respirator
(§§1910.1048(f)(2) and (g)).
If employees’ eyes or skin may become splashed with solutions
containing 1 percent or greater formaldehyde, protective clothing
and equipment must be provided (§1910.1048(h)(1)), along with
conveniently located eyewashes and quick drench showers
(§§1910.1048(i)(2) and (3)).
The employer must establish regulated areas and restrict access
to authorized employees wherever the airborne concentration of
airborne formaldehyde exceeds either the TWA or the STEL, and
post warning signs at all entrances to the area (§1910.1048(e)).
For operations involving formaldehyde liquids or gas, a preventive
maintenance program is required to ensure that all leaks are
repaired and spills are cleaned promptly by employees wearing
suitable protective equipment and trained in proper methods for
cleanup and decontamination (§1910.1048(j)).
In the event of emergencies involving formaldehyde, a plan to
ensure that appropriate procedures are followed to minimize injury
and loss of life must be implemented (§1910.1048(k)).
A medical surveillance program is required for employees exposed
to formaldehyde at concentrations at or exceeding the action level
or exceeding the STEL (§1910.1048(l)(1)(i)), and for employees who
develop signs and symptoms of overexposure to formaldehyde, or
who are exposed to formaldehyde in emergencies (§1910.1048(l)

requirements of the standard or used in place of initial monitoring;
records of all measurements taken to monitor employee exposure
to formaldehyde; and a record for each employee subject to
medical surveillance requirements of this section (§1910.1048(o)).

Lead
Employee exposure to lead must be limited to a permissible
exposure limit (PEL) of 50 micrograms per cubic meter of air (µg/m3)
as an 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA) (§1910.1025(c)(1)). When
determining TWA exposures, employers must adjust for a greater
than 8-hour workday and may consider respirator protection factors
and duration of respirator use (§§1910.1025(c)(2) and (3)).
For each shift, job, and work area, employers must collect
representative, full-shift (minimum of 7 continuous hours) personal
samples for employees likely to have the greatest exposure
(§§1910.1025(d)(1)(ii) through (iii) and (d)(3)(ii)). Employers must
conduct periodic monitoring for employees exposed above the
action level (30 μg/m3 TWA) or when there has been a production,
process, control, or personnel change (§§1910.1025(d)(6)(ii) through
(iii) and (d)(7)).

54 • OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION

Employers must use engineering and work practice controls to
reduce and maintain employee exposure at or below the TWA

comply with requirements of the respiratory protection program
and respirator selection (§§1910.1025(f)(2)(i) and (ii), (f)(3)(i)(A)
through (C), and (f)(3)(ii)). If employees are exposed to lead above
the PEL or could experience skin or eye irritation, employers must
provide appropriate protective clothing and equipment and provide
for its cleaning, disposal, and repair (§§1910.1025(g)(1), (g)(1)(i)
through (iii), and (g)(2)(i) through (ii)). Employers must require
that employees remove contaminated clothing in change rooms
and place the clothing in sealable containers that are labeled with
warnings and prohibited activities (§§1910.1025(g)(2)(iv) through
(viii)).
Employers must provide medical surveillance to employees who
are or may be exposed to lead at or above the action level for at
least 30 days a year (§§1910.1025(j)(1)(i) and (j)(2)(i)(A)). Employers
must make available medical examinations and consultations at

58 • OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION

Employers must develop and implement a written plan for
each workplace where there is a possibility of an emergency
(§1910.1050(d)(1)(i)). The plan must cover respiratory protection
for employees engaged in correcting emergency conditions,
emergency action procedures, and fire prevention elements
(§§1910.1050(d)(1)(ii) and (iii)).
Employers must post and maintain legible signs for regulated

and training on MDA at the time of initial assignment and at least
annually thereafter (§1910.1050(k)(4)(i)).
This standard also contains requirements for medical removal and
recordkeeping (§§1910.1050(m)(9)(v) and (n)).

Hazard Communication
The purpose of the Hazard Communication standard is to ensure
that the hazards of all chemicals produced or imported are classified,
and that information concerning the classified hazards is transmitted
downstream to employers and employees. OSHA has modified its
Hazard Communication standard to be consistent with the provisions
of the United Nations Globally Harmonized System of Classification
and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS), Revision 3. This modification to
the standard will internationally harmonize OSHA’s classification and
hazard communication system, establishing uniform pictograms,
hazard phrases, label elements, and safety data sheets. This update
to the Hazard Communication standard will improve the quality and
consistency of information, enhance the effectiveness of hazard
communication, ensure that employees are apprised of the chemical
hazards to which they may be exposed, and reduce the incidence of
chemical-related occupational illnesses and injuries.
Hazard Communication requires chemical manufacturers and
importers to evaluate the chemicals they produce or import,
and provide hazard information to downstream employers and
employees. This transmittal of information is to be accomplished by
means of labeling and safety data sheets (§§1910.1200(f)(1) and (g)
(1)). Label elements, such as signal words, hazard statements, and
pictograms have been harmonized, and assigned to each hazard
class and category.
GENERAL INDUSTRY DIGEST • 59

In order to classify chemical hazards, the importer or manufacturer
is provided with specific criteria and detailed instructions for hazard
evaluation and determinations. Additionally, mandatory Appendices
A and B provide classification guidance for Health Hazards and
Physical Hazards, respectively (§1910.1200(d)(1)). Once a chemical
has been classified, the label/safety data sheet preparer can obtain
the relevant harmonized information from the Appendixes of the
standard.
Chemical manufacturers, importers, or distributors must ensure
that each container of classified hazardous chemicals leaving
the workplace is labeled, tagged, or marked with the following
information: a product identifier, signal words, hazard statements,
pictograms, precautionary statements, and the name, address, and
telephone number of the chemical manufacturer, importer, or other
responsible party (§1910.1200(f)(1)). Chemical manufacturers or
importers must ensure that distributors and employers are provided
an appropriate safety data sheet with their initial shipment, and with
the first shipment after a safety data sheet is updated (§1910.1200(g)
(6)(i)). The employer must maintain, in the workplace, copies of the
required safety data sheets for each hazardous chemical and must
ensure that they are readily accessible during each work shift to
employees when they are in their work areas (§1910.1200(g)(8)).
Employers must develop, implement, and maintain at each
workplace a written, comprehensive hazard communication
program which at least describes how the criteria for labels
and other forms of warnings, safety data sheets, and employee
information and training will be met, and which also includes a list
of the hazardous chemicals known to be present using a product
identifier that is referenced on the appropriate safety data sheet
(the list may be compiled for the workplace as a whole or for
individual work areas); and, the methods the employer will use to
inform employees of the hazards of non-routine tasks (for example,
the cleaning of reactor vessels), and the hazards associated
with chemicals contained in unlabeled pipes in their work areas
(§§1910.1200(e)(1)(i) and (e)(1)(ii)).
Employers are required to provide effective information and train
employees on the hazards of the hazardous chemicals in the work
area. At a minimum, employee training must include: methods and
60 • OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION

observations that may be used to detect the presence or release
of a hazardous chemical in the work area (such as monitoring
conducted by the employer, continuous monitoring devices, visual
appearance or odor of hazardous chemicals when being released);
the physical and health hazards of the chemicals in the work area;
the measures employees can take to protect themselves from
these hazards, including specific procedures the employer has
implemented to protect employees from exposure to hazardous
chemicals, such as appropriate work practices, emergency
procedures, and personal protective equipment to be used; and
the details of the hazard communication program developed by
the employer, including an explanation of the labels received on
shipped containers and the workplace labeling system used by their
employer; the safety data sheet, including the order of information
and how employees can obtain and use the appropriate hazard
information (§§1910.1200(h)(3)(i) through (iv)).

Exposure to Hazardous Chemicals in Laboratories
The requirements in 29 CFR 1910.1450 apply to all employers
engaged in the laboratory use of hazardous chemicals (§1910.1450(a)
(1)). “Laboratory use of hazardous chemicals” is defined as the
handling or use of hazardous chemicals in which all of the following
conditions are met: (i) chemical manipulations are carried out on a
“laboratory scale”; (ii) multiple chemical procedures or chemicals
are used; (iii) the procedures involved are not part of a production
process, nor in any way simulate a production process; and (iv)
“protective laboratory practices and equipment” are available and
in common use to minimize the potential for employee exposure to
hazardous chemicals (§1910.1450(b)).
For laboratory uses of OSHA regulated substances, the employer
must assure that laboratory employees’ exposures to such
substances do not exceed the permissible exposure limits specified
in 29 CFR part 1910, subpart Z (§1910.1450(c)).
Where there is reason to believe that exposure levels of a hazardous
substance routinely exceed the action level (or in the absence of an
action level, the PEL), employers must conduct initial monitoring to
measure each employee’s exposure (§1910.1450(d)(1)).
GENERAL INDUSTRY DIGEST • 61

If the initial monitoring discloses employee exposure over the
action level (or in the absence of an action level, the PEL), the
employer must immediately comply with the exposure monitoring
requirements of the relevant standard (§1910.1450(d)(2)).
Termination of monitoring of the particular hazardous substance,
requiring periodic monitoring, may only be determined in accord
with the requirements under the relevant standard (§1910.1450(d)
(3)). Within 15 days of receipt of any monitoring results, the
employer must notify affected employees of the results in writing
either individually or by posting results in an appropriate location
that is accessible to employees (§1910.1450(d)(4)).
Where hazardous chemicals are used in the workplace (laboratory),
the employer must develop a written Chemical Hygiene Plan and
carry out its provisions (§1910.1450(e)(1)). This plan must be made
readily available to employees and their representatives, as well as
be capable of protecting employees from health hazards associated
with the hazardous chemicals in that laboratory and keeping
exposures below the permissible exposure limits specified in 29
CFR part 1910, subpart Z (§§1910.1450(e)(1)(i) and (ii), and (e)(2)).

Ionizing Radiation
Employers must be responsible for proper controls to prevent any
employee from being exposed to ionizing radiation in excess of
acceptable limits (§1910.1096(c)(1)). No employer may possess,
use, or transfer sources of ionizing radiation in such a manner as
to cause any individual to receive a dose in excess of those in Table
G-18, below, (§1910.1096(b)(1)), with the exception that an employer
may permit an individual to receive doses to the whole body
greater than those permitted so long as: (1) During the calendar
quarter4 the dose to the whole body must not exceed 3 rems;
(2) the dose to the whole body, when added to the accumulated
occupational dose must not exceed 5 (N-18) rems, where “N”
equals the individual’s age in years at his/her last birthday; and
(3) the employer maintains adequate past and current exposure
records (§§1910.1096(b)(2)(i) through (iii)).

4

Calendar quarter means any 3-month period determined as per §1910.1096(b)(4).

62 • OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION

Each radiation area must be conspicuously posted with appropriate
signs and/or barriers (§1910.1096(e)).
Employers must maintain records of the radiation exposure
to all employees for whom personnel monitoring is required
(§§1910.1096(b)(2)(iii) and (n)(1)).

DOT Markings, Placards and Labels
Employers who receive shipments of hazardous materials that
are required to be marked, placarded or labeled in accord with
the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Hazardous Materials
Regulations (49 CFR Parts 171 through 180) must retain such
warnings on the packaging and transport until the hazardous
materials are removed (§1910.1201(a)).
Other shipments received by freight container, rail freight
car, motor vehicle, or transport vehicle that are required to be
marked or placarded in accord with the DOT Hazardous Materials
Regulations must retain those markings and placards on the freight
container, rail freight car, motor vehicle or transport vehicle until the
hazardous materials are sufficiently removed (§1910.1201(b)).

Personal Protective Equipment
Proper protective equipment, including personal protective
equipment (PPE) for eyes, face, head, and extremities, protective
clothing, respiratory devices, hearing protection, and protective
shields and barriers, must be provided, used, and maintained in

However, employer-required payment does not apply to nonspecialty safety-toe protective footwear (including steel-toe shoes
or steel-toe boots) and non-specialty prescription safety eyewear,
provided that the employer permits such items to be worn off the
job-site (§1910.132(h)(2)).
Where employees provide their own protective equipment,
the employer is responsible for assuring its adequacy, proper
maintenance, and sanitation (§1910.132(b)).
On occasions where the employer provides metatarsal guards and
allows the employee, at his or her request, to use shoes or boots
with built-in metatarsal protection, the employer is not required to
reimburse the employee for the shoes or boots (§1910.132(h)(3)).
In addition, employers are not required to pay for: logging boots
required by §1910.266(d)(1)(v); everyday clothing, such as longsleeve shirts, long pants, street shoes, and normal work boots;
or ordinary clothing, skin creams, or other items used solely for
protection from weather, such as winter coats, jackets, gloves,
parkas, rubber boots, hats, raincoats, ordinary sunglasses, and
sunscreen (§1910.132(h)(4)).
The employer must assess the workplace to determine if hazards
are present, or are likely to be present, which necessitate the use
of personal protective equipment (head, eye, face, foot, hand, or
respiratory protection). If such hazards are present, or are likely
to be present, the employer must select and have employees
use the type(s) of personal protective equipment (PPE) that will
protect them from the hazards identified in the hazard assessment.
Employers must also communicate the selection decisions to
employees, and ensure that the PPE chosen for them properly fits
(§1910.132(d)).

64 • OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION

The employer must provide training to each employee who is
required to use PPE, so they know at least the following: when PPE
is necessary; what PPE is necessary; how to properly don (put on),
doff (take off), adjust, and wear PPE; the limitations of the PPE;
and the proper care, maintenance, useful life, and disposal of PPE
(§1910.132(f)).

Eye and Face Protection
Employers must ensure that each affected employee uses
appropriate eye or face protection when exposed to eye or face
hazards from flying particles, molten metal, liquid chemicals, acids
or caustic liquids, chemical gases or vapors, or potentially injurious
light radiation (§1910.133(a)(1)).
Protective eye and face protection devices must comply with any of
the following consensus standards:
•

ANSI Z87.1-2003, “American National Standard Practice for
Occupational and Educational Eye and Face Protection”
(§1910.133(b)(1)(i)),

•

ANSI Z87.1-1989 (R-1998), “American National Standard Practice
for Occupational and Educational Eye and Face Protection”
(§1910.133(b)(1)(ii)), or

•

ANSI Z87.1-1989, “American National Standard Practice for
Occupational and Educational Eye and Face Protection”
(§1910.133(b)(1)(iii)).

Protective eye and face protection devices that the employer
demonstrates are at least as effective as protective eye and face
protection devices that are constructed in accord with one of the
above consensus standards will be deemed to be in compliance
with the requirements of this section (§1910.133(b)(2)).
Eyewash/Drench Shower
Suitable facilities for quick drenching or flushing of the eyes
and body must be provided within the work area for immediate
emergency use if there is a possibility that an employee might be
exposed to injurious, corrosive materials (§1910.151(c)).

GENERAL INDUSTRY DIGEST • 65

Foot Protection
Foot protective equipment must be worn when working in areas
where there is a danger of foot injuries due to falling or rolling
objects or objects piercing the sole, and where employees’ feet are
exposed to electrical hazards (§1910.136(a)). Protective footwear
must comply with any of the following consensus standards:
•

ASTM F-2412-2005, “Standard Test Methods for Foot Protection,”
and ASTM F-2413-2005, “Standard Specification for Performance
Requirements for Protective Footwear” (§1910.136(b)(1)(i));

•

ANSI Z41-1999, “American National Standard for Personal
Protection – Protective Footwear” (§1910.136(b)(1)(ii)); or

•

ANSI Z41-1991, “American National Standard for Personal
Protection – Protective Footwear” (§1910.136(b)(1)(iii)).

In the logging industry, employers must assure that each employee
wears foot protection, such as heavy-duty logging boots that are
waterproof or water repellent that covers and provides support
to the ankle. The employer must assure that each employee who
operates a chain saw wears foot protection that is constructed
with cut-resistant material which will protect the employee against
contact with a running chain saw. Sharp, calk-soled boots or
other slip-resistant type boots may be worn where the employer
demonstrates that they are necessary for the employee’s job, the
terrain, the timber type, and the weather conditions, provided
that foot protection otherwise required by this paragraph is met
(§1910.266(d)(1)(v)).
Electrically conductive shoes should be considered as a required,
supplementary form of protection for work activities in which
there is a danger of fire or explosion from the discharge of static
electricity. Electrical-hazard or dielectric (nonconductive) footwear
should be considered as a required, supplementary form of
protection when an employee standing on the ground is exposed
to hazardous step or touch potential (the difference in electrical
potential between the feet or between the hands and feet). Such
footwear should also be worn when primary forms of electrical
protective equipment, such as rubber insulating gloves and
blankets, do not provide complete protection for an employee
standing on the ground.
66 • OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION

Head Protection
Head protection equipment, such as helmets and hard hats must be
worn when there is a possible danger of head injuries from impact,
flying or falling objects, or electrical shock and burns (§§1910.135(a)
(1) and (a)(2)).
Head protection must comply with any of the following consensus
standards:
•

ANSI Z89.1-2009, “American National Standard for Industrial
Head Protection” (§1910.135(b)(1)(i));

•

ANSI Z89.1-2003, “American National Standard for Industrial
Head Protection” (§1910.135(b)(1)(ii)); or

•

ANSI Z89.1-1997, “American National Standard for Personnel
Protection – Protective Headwear for Industrial Workers –
Requirements” (§1910.135(b)(1)(iii)).

Head protection devices that the employer demonstrates are at
least as effective as head protection devices that are constructed
in accord with one of the above consensus standards will be
deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this section
(§1910.135(b)(2)).

Respiratory Protection
Suitable respirators selected on the basis of the hazard to which the
worker is exposed must be provided by the employer as necessary
to protect the health of the workers (§1910.134(a)(2)).
Where respirators are required, the employer must establish and
maintain a respiratory protection program. The program must
be regularly evaluated to determine its continued effectiveness
(§§1910.134(a)(2) and (c)(1)).
The employer must include in the program, as applicable, the
procedures for selecting respirators for use in the workplace; medical
evaluations of employees required to use respirators; fit testing
procedures for tight-fitting respirators; procedures for proper use
of respirators in routine and reasonably foreseeable emergency
situations; procedures and schedules for cleaning, disinfecting,
storing, inspecting, repairing, discarding, and otherwise maintaining
respirators; procedures to ensure adequate air quality, quantity, and
GENERAL INDUSTRY DIGEST • 67

flow of breathing air for atmosphere-supplying respirators; training
of employees in the respiratory hazards to which they are potentially
exposed during routine and emergency situations; training of
employees in the proper use of respirators, including putting on and
removing them, any limitations on their use, and their maintenance;
and procedures for regularly evaluating the effectiveness of the
program (§§1910.134(c)(1)(i) through (1)(ix)).
Employers must provide each respirator user with a respirator that
is clean, sanitary, and in good working order. Respirators must be
cleaned and disinfected as often as necessary to be maintained in a
sanitary condition (§1910.134(h)(1)(i)).
All respirators must be stored to protect them from damage,
contamination, dust, sunlight, extreme temperatures, excessive
moisture, and damaging chemicals, and they must be packed or
stored to prevent deformation of the facepiece and exhalation valve
(§1910.134(h)(2)(i)).
The employer must ensure that (1) all respirators used in routine
situations must be inspected before each use and during cleaning
(§§1910.134(h)(3)(i)(A)), and (2) all respirators maintained for use
in emergency situations must be inspected at least monthly and
in accord with the manufacturer’s recommendations, and must be
checked for proper function before and after each use (§1910.134(h)
(3)(i)(B)).
When inspecting respirators, the employer must ensure that the
equipment is checked for function, tightness of connections, and
the condition of the various parts including, but not limited to, the
facepiece, head straps, valves, connecting tube, and cartridges,
canisters or filters; that there are not any signs of deterioration; and
that the elastomeric parts are still pliable (§§1910.134(h)(3)(ii)(A)
and (B)).
Employers must provide effective training to employees who are
required to use respirators. The training must be comprehensive,
understandable, and recur annually and more often if necessary
(§1910.134(k)).
From the training received, employees must be able to demonstrate
knowledge of at least the following: why the respirator is necessary
and how improper fit, usage, or maintenance can compromise
68 • OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION

the protective effect of the respirator; what the limitations and
capabilities of the respirator are; how to use the respirator
effectively in emergency situations, including situations in which
the respirator malfunctions; how to inspect, put on and remove,
use, and check the seals of the respirator; what the procedures are
for maintenance and storage of the respirator; how to recognize
medical signs and symptoms that may limit or prevent the effective
use of respirators; and the general requirements of the OSHA
Respiratory Protection standard (§§1910.134(k)(1)(i) through (vii)).
Training must be provided to employees before requiring them
to use a respirator in the workplace and must be conducted in a
manner that is understandable to them (§§1910.134(k)(2) and (3)).

Fall Protection
Employees on working platforms must be protected by a personal fall
arrest system (§1910.66(j)). All fall arrest system connectors must be
drop forged, constructed with pressed or formed steel, or equivalent
materials. Connectors must also have a corrosion-resistant finish,
and all surfaces and edges must be smooth to prevent damage to
interfacing parts of the system (§1910.66, Appendix C, paragraph d).
OSHA standards (§1910.66, Appendix C, paragraphs (c)(1) through
(c)(11)) also require that:
•

Lanyards and vertical lifelines have a minimum breaking
strength of 5,000 pounds (22.2 kN);

•

Self-retracting lifelines and lanyards that automatically limit
free fall distance to two feet (0.61 m) or less have components
capable of sustaining a minimum static tensile load of 3,000
pounds (13.3 kN) applied to the device when fully extended;

•

Self-retracting lifelines and lanyards that do not limit free fall
distance, ripstitch lanyards, and tearing and deforming lanyards
be capable of sustaining a minimum tensile load of 5,000
pounds (22.2 kN) applied to the device when fully extended;

•

Dee-rings and snap-hooks be capable of sustaining a minimum
tensile load of 5,000 pounds (22.2 kN), in addition to being
100 percent proof-tested to a minimum tensile load of 3,600
pounds (16 kN) without cracking, breaking, or taking permanent
deformation;
GENERAL INDUSTRY DIGEST • 69

•

Snap-hooks be sized to avoid unintentional disengagement due
to depression, or be of locking type to prevent disengagement;

•

Horizontal lifelines, where used, be designed, and installed as
part of a complete personal fall arrest system, with a safety
factor of at least two, under the supervision of a qualified
person; anchorages be capable of supporting at least 5,000
pounds (22.2 kN) per employee attached, or designed, installed,
and used as part of a complete personal fall arrest system,
with a safety factor of at least two, under the supervision of a
qualified person; and

•

Ropes and straps (webbing) used in lanyards, lifelines, and
strength components of body harnesses, be made from
synthetic fibers or wire rope.

Personal fall arrest systems must be rigged so that an employee
can neither free fall more than six feet (1.8 m), nor contact any
lower level (§1910.66, Appendix C, paragraph (e)(3)). When stopping
a fall, personal fall arrest systems must be capable of: limiting the
maximum arresting force to 1,800 pounds (8 kN); bringing a worker
to a complete stop and limit their maximum deceleration distance
traveled to 3.5 feet (1.07 m); and having sufficient strength to
withstand twice the potential impact energy of the worker (§1910.66
Appendix C, paragraph (d)).
Care must be taken to ensure that equipment is appropriately
rigged to avoid disengagement. Snap-hooks, unless of a locking
type, must not be directly attached to webbing, rope or wire rope;
another snap-hook; a dee-ring with another snap-hook or other
connector attached; a horizontal lifeline; or any other incompatible
object that could cause the snap-hook to depress and release itself
(§1910.66, Appendix C, paragraph (e)).
Equipment/components used for personal fall arrest systems must
only be used for the purpose of employee fall protection (§1910.66,
Appendix C, paragraph (e)(6)). Such systems must be inspected
prior to each use for mildew, wear, damage and other deterioration,
and defective components must be removed from service if their
strength or function may be adversely affected (§1910.66, Appendix
C, paragraph (f)). Further, any personal fall arrest systems or

70 • OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION

components subjected to impact loading must be immediately
removed from service and never used again for employee fall
protection, unless inspected and determined by a competent
person to be undamaged and suitable for reuse (§1910.66, Appendix
C, paragraph (e)(7)).
Before using a personal fall arrest system and after any component
or system is changed, employees must be trained in the recognition
of, and preventive measures for, the safety hazards associated with
their individual work tasks; general recognition and prevention
of safety hazards associated with the use of working platforms;
emergency action plan procedures; work procedures; and personal
fall arrest system inspection, care, use and system performance
(§1910.66, Appendix C, paragraphs (i)(1)(ii)(A) through (E), and (e)(9)).

Medical Services
Medical Records and Employee Exposure Records
Employers must, upon request, make sure that each employee
or their designated representative has access to their exposure
records (§1910.1020(e)(2)(i)(A)). Upon an employee’s first entering
into employment, and at least annually thereafter, each employer
must inform employees of the existence, location, and availability
of their medical records; the person responsible for maintaining
and providing access to their records; and their right of access to
these records (§§1910.1020(g)(1)(i) through (iii)).

Medical Services and First Aid
The employer must ensure the ready availability of medical
personnel for advice and consultation on matters of occupational
health (§1910.151(a)).
When a medical facility for treatment of injured employees is not
available in near proximity to the workplace, a person or persons
must be adequately trained to render first aid. First-aid supplies
must be well maintained and readily available for use by trained
first-aid personnel (§1910.151(b)).

GENERAL INDUSTRY DIGEST • 71

Fire Protection
Only approved portable fire extinguishers must be used
(§1910.157(c)(2)). If portable fire extinguishers are provided for
employee use, the employer must mount, locate, and identify them
so they are readily accessible to employees without subjecting
the employees to possible injury. These fire extinguishers must be
maintained in a fully charged and operable condition and kept in
their designated places at all times except during use (§1910.157(c)).
Employers must ensure that the appropriate types of portable fire
extinguishers are selected and appropriately distributed in the
workplace (§1910.36(d)). Extinguishers must also be visually checked
monthly, maintenance checked annually, and hydrostatically tested at
the intervals indicated (§1910.157(e) and (f)).
Where the employer has provided portable fire extinguishers for
employee use in the workplace, the employer also must provide
educational and training programs to familiarize employees with
the general principles of fire extinguisher use and the hazards
involved with incipient stage firefighting (§1910.157(g)(1)).

Welding, Cutting and Brazing
Welding General Requirements
Arc welding cables with damaged insulation or exposed, bare
conductors must be replaced (§1910.254(d)(9)(iii)).
For special considerations when welding operations require fluxes,
coverings, coatings, or alloys involving fluorine compounds, zinc,
lead, beryllium, cadmium, or mercury, employers should refer to
§§1910.252(c)(5) through (12).
Mechanical ventilation must be provided when welding or cutting is
performed either:
•

In a space of less than 10,000 cubic feet (284 cubic meters) per
welder (§1910.252(c)(2)(i)(A));

•

In a room having a ceiling height of less than 16 feet (5 m)
(§1910.252(c)(2)(i)(B)); or

72 • OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION

•

In confined spaces or where the welding space contains
partitions, balconies, or other structural barriers to the extent that
they significantly obstruct cross ventilation (§1910.252(c)(2)(i)(C)).

Proper shielding and eye protection to prevent exposure of
personnel from welding hazards must be provided (§§1910.252(b)
(2)(i)(B) through (D) and (F) through (H)).
Where the work permits, the welder should be enclosed in an
individual booth painted with a finish of low reflectivity such as
zinc oxide (an important factor for absorbing ultraviolet radiations)
and lamp black, or must be enclosed with noncombustible screens
similarly painted. Booths and screens must permit circulation
of air at floor level. Workers or other persons adjacent to the
welding areas must be protected from the rays by noncombustible
or flameproof screens or shields or must be required to wear
appropriate goggles (§1910.252(b)(2)(iii)).
Proper precautions (isolating welding and cutting, removing fire
hazards and combustibles, and providing a fire watch) for fire
prevention must be taken in areas where welding or other “hot
work” is being done (§1910.252(a)).

Welding in Confined Spaces
All welding and cutting operations that are performed in confined
spaces (such as a tank, boiler, or a pressure vessel) must be
adequately ventilated to prevent the accumulation of toxic materials
or possible oxygen deficiency (§1910.252(c)(4)(i)).
In such circumstances where it is impossible to provide such
ventilation, airline respirators approved by the National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) for this purpose must be
used (§1910.252(c)(4)(ii)).
In areas immediately hazardous to life, full-facepiece, pressuredemand, self-contained breathing apparatus or a combination
full-facepiece, pressure-demand supplied-air respirator with an
auxiliary, self-contained air supply must be used. The breathing
equipment must be approved by NIOSH under 42 CFR part 84
(§1910.252(c)(4)(iii)).

GENERAL INDUSTRY DIGEST • 73

Where welding operations are performed in confined spaces and
where welders and helpers are provided with airline respirators or
self-contained breathing equipment, a worker must be stationed on
the outside of such confined spaces to ensure the safety of those
working within (§1910.146(d)(6) and §1910.252(c)(4)(iv)).
Oxygen must never be used for ventilation (§1910.252(c)(4)(v)).

Materials Handling and Storage
Chains, Cables, Ropes and Hooks
Hooks and chains used with overhead or gantry cranes must be
visually inspected daily. Monthly inspections must be done with
a certification record, dated, and signed by the inspector and kept
on file readily available to appointed personnel. Running ropes
must be thoroughly inspected at least monthly and a certification
record kept on file and readily available to appointed personnel.
A certification record must include: the date of inspection, the
signature of the person who performed the inspection, and the
serial number, or other identifier (§§1910.179(j)(1)(ii)(a) and (b), (j)
(2), and (m)(1)). All U-bolt clips on hoist ropes on overhead and
gantry cranes must be installed so that the U-bolt is in contact with
the dead end (short or nonload carrying end) of the rope. Clips must
be installed in accord with the clip manufacturer’s recommendation.
All nuts on newly installed clips must be tightened after 1 hour of
use (§1910.179(h)(2)(v)).
Hoist ropes on crawler, locomotive, and truck cranes must be free
from kinks or twists and must not be wrapped around the load
(§§1910.180(h)(2)(i) and (h)(3)(ii)(a)).
Slings and their fastenings and attachments must be inspected
daily before use. Damaged or defective slings must be immediately
removed from service (§1910.184(d)).
Hooks that have been opened more than 15 percent of the normal
throat opening measured at the narrowest point or hooks that are
twisted more than 10 degrees out of alignment are to be evaluated
before use to determine if they are safe for the intended load
(§1910.180(d)(3)(v) and §1910.184(e)(9)(ii)).

74 • OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION

Cranes (Overhead and Mobile), Hoists and Derricks
All functional operating mechanisms, air and hydraulic systems,
chains, ropes, slings, hooks, and other lifting equipment must
be visually inspected daily (§1910.179(j)(2), §1910.180(d)(3), and
§1910.184(d)).
Complete inspection of the crane must be performed at 1-month
to 12-month intervals depending on its activity, severity of service,
and environmental conditions. The inspection must include the
following areas: identification of deformed, cracked, corroded,
worn, or loose members or parts; the brake system; limit indicators
(wind, load); power plant, and electrical apparatus (§1910.179(j)(3),
§1910.180(d)(4), and §1910.181(d)(3)(i)).
Unsafe conditions disclosed by the inspection requirements must
be corrected before the operation is resumed and the crane must
not be operated until all guards have been reinstalled (§1910.179(l)
(3)(i), §1910.180(f), and §1910.181(f)(3)(i)).
Overhead cranes must have stops at the limits of travel of the
trolley. Bridge and trolley bumpers or equivalent automatic
devices must be provided. Bridge trucks must have tail sweeps
(§§1910.179(e)(1) through (4)).
The rated load of the crane must be plainly marked on each side
of the crane, and if the crane has more than one hoisting unit,
each hoist must have its rated load marked on it or its load block,
and this marking must be clearly legible from the ground or floor
(§1910.179(b)(5)).
Pendant control boxes must be clearly marked for identification of
functions (§1910.179(g)(1)(v)).
There must be no hoisting, lowering, or traveling while any
employee is on the load or hook (§1910.179(n)(3)(v), §1910.180(h)(3)
(v), and §1910.181(i)(3)(v)).

Storage
All stored materials (containers, bags, bundles, etc.) stacked in tiers
must be stacked, blocked, interlocked, and limited in height so that
they are secure against sliding or collapse (§1910.176(b)). Storage
areas must be kept free from accumulation of materials that
GENERAL INDUSTRY DIGEST • 75

constitute hazards from tripping, fire, explosion or pest harborage.
Vegetation control will be exercised when necessary (§1910.176(c)).
Where mechanical handling equipment is used, sufficient safe
clearance must be allowed for aisles, at loading docks, through
doorways, and whenever turns or passage must be made. Aisles
and passageways must be kept clear and in good repair, with
no obstruction across or in aisles that could create a hazard.
Permanent aisles and passageways must be appropriately marked
(§1910.176(a)).

Hazardous Equipment and Machinery
Air Receivers
All new air receivers installed must be designed and constructed
to meet the standards of the American Society of Mechanical
Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section VIII,
1968 (§1910.169(a)(2)(i)).
Drain pipes and valves must be installed at the lowest point of
every air receiver to provide for the removal of accumulated oil
and water, which must be done frequently and at such intervals as
to prevent the accumulation of excessive amounts of liquid in the
receiver. Adequate automatic traps may be installed in addition to
drain valves (§1910.169(b)(2)).
All air receivers must be equipped with an indicating pressure
gauge (so located as to be readily visible) and with one or more
spring-loaded safety valve(s) (§1910.169(b)(3)(i)). All safety valves
must be tested frequently and at regular intervals to determine
whether they are in good operating condition (§1910.169(b)(3)(iv)).

Belt Sanding Machines
Belt sanding machines used for woodworking must be provided
with guards at each nip point where the sanding belt runs on to a
pulley. These guards must effectively prevent the operator’s hands
and fingers from coming into contact with the nip points. Also,
the unused run of the sanding belt must be guarded to prevent
accidental contact (§1910.213(p)(4)).

76 • OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION

Use of Compressed Air
Compressed air must not be used for cleaning purposes unless the
pressure does not exceed 30 pounds (13.5 kilograms) per square
inch (6.5 square centimeters) when the nozzle end is obstructed
or dead-ended, and then only with effective chip guarding and
personal protective equipment (§1910.242(b)).

Fan Blades
When the periphery of the blades of a fan is less than 7 feet (2.1
meters) above the floor or working level, the blades must be
guarded. The guard must have openings no larger than 1/2 inch
(12.7 millimeters) (§1910.212(a)(5)).

Forklift Trucks (Powered Industrial Trucks)
If at any time a powered industrial truck is found to be in need of
repair, defective, or in any way unsafe, the truck must be taken out
of service until it has been restored to safe operating condition
(§1910.178(p)(1)).
High Lift Rider trucks must be equipped with substantial overhead
guards unless operating conditions do not permit (§1910.178(e)(1)).
Forklift trucks must be equipped with vertical-load, backrest
extensions when the types of loads present a hazard to the
operators (§1910.178(e)(2)).
The brakes of trucks must be set and wheel blocks (i.e., chocks)
must be placed under the rear wheels to prevent the movement
of trucks, trailers, or railroad cars while loading or unloading
(§1910.178(m)(7)).
Only a trained and authorized operator must be permitted to operate a
powered industrial truck. Methods must be devised to train operators
in the safe operation of powered industrial trucks (§1910.178(l)).
Further, workers under 18 years of age are not permitted to operate
forklift trucks or powered industrial trucks (29 CFR 570.58, Order 7).
For more information on youth-worker requirements see OSHA
Safety and Health Information Bulletin, SHIB 03-09-30.

GENERAL INDUSTRY DIGEST • 77

Hand Tools
Portable electric equipment must be handled in a manner that will
not cause damage. When the cord and plug connected tools are
relocated they must be visually inspected before use on any shift
for external defects (such as loose parts, deformed and missing
pins, or damage to outer jacket or insulation) and for evidence of
possible internal damage (such as pinched or crushed outer jacket)
(§§1910.334(a)(1) and (a)(2)).
Each employer must be responsible for the safe condition of tools
and equipment used by employees, including tools and equipment
which may be furnished by employees (§1910.242(a)).
Portable electrical tools and equipment, except when UL approved
double insulated construction (and distinctively marked as such),
must be properly grounded (§1910.304(g)(6)(vii)(B)).
All hand tools must be kept in a serviceable condition. Handles
and guards of tools must be kept tight in the tool and wooden
handles must be free of splinters and sharp edges. Heads of shock,
impact-driven and driving tools must be properly shaped, free
of mushroomed heads, and are sufficiently sharp. If the cutting
edge of a tool becomes dull, it must be sharpened in accord with
manufacturer’s specifications. When the head of any shock, impactdriven or driving tool begins to chip, it must be repaired or removed
from service (§1910.266(e)(1)).
All non-current-carrying metal parts of portable equipment and
fixed equipment including their associated fences, housings,
enclosures, and supporting structures must be grounded
(§§1910.304(g)(6)(vi), (g)(6)(vii), and (g)(8)(i)).
For construction-like activities, any 125-volt, single-phase, portable
electric tool or equipment and its associated extension cord set that
is connected to a 15-, 20-, or 30-ampre outlet must be protected by
a ground-fault circuit interrupter (§1910.304(b)(3)(ii)(A)).

Machine Guarding
Machine guarding must be provided to protect the operator and
other employees in the machine area from hazards such as those
created by point of operation, ingoing nip points, rotating parts,
78 • OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION

flying chips, and sparks. The guard must be such that it does not
pose an accident hazard in itself. Some examples of guarding
methods include barrier guards, two-hand tripping devices, and
electronic safety devices (§§1910.212(a)(1) and (2)).
The point of operation of machines whose operation exposes an
employee to injury must be guarded. The guarding device must be
so designed as to prevent the operator from having any part of his
body in the danger zone during the operating cycle (§1910.212(a)
(3)(ii)). Special handtools for placing and removing material must
permit easy handling of material without the operator placing a
hand in the danger zone. However, such tools must only be used to
supplement protection provided and not replace the use of other
required guarding as listed above (§1910.212(a)(3)(iii)).
Some of the machines that usually require point of operation
guarding are guillotine cutters, shears, alligator shears, power
presses, milling machines, power saws, jointers, portable power
tools, forming rolls, and calenders (§§1910.212(a)(3)(iv)(a) through (i)).

Fixed Machinery
Machines designed for a fixed location must be securely anchored
to prevent walking or moving during operation (§1910.212(b)).

Mechanical Power Presses
The employer must provide and ensure the usage of point-ofoperation guards or properly applied and adjusted point-of-operation
devices to prevent entry of hands or fingers into the point of
operation by reaching through, over, under, and around the guard
on every operation performed on a mechanical power press. This
requirement does not apply when the point-of-operation opening is
1/4 inch (6 mm) or less (§§1910.217(c)(1)(i) and (ii), and (c)(2)(i)(a)). A
point-of-operation guard must also be designed, constructed, and
adjusted so that no pinch points between the guard and moving
machine parts are created; the possibility of misuse or removal of
essential parts is minimized through the utilization of fasteners not
readily removable by operator; maximum visibility of the point
of operation is provided; and easy inspection can be performed
(§§1910.217(c)(2)(i) and (c)(2)(i)(c) through (f)).
GENERAL INDUSTRY DIGEST • 79

Hand and foot operations must be provided with guards to prevent
inadvertent activation of the press (§§1910.217(b)(4)(i) and (b)(5)(i)
through (ii)).
The employer must provide and enforce the use of safety blocks
whenever dies are being adjusted or repaired in the press. Brushes,
swabs, lubricating rolls, and automatic or manual pressure guns, or
other tools must be provided for lubrication so that operators and
diesetters must not be required to reach into the point of operation
or other hazard areas (§§1910.217(d)(9)(iv) and (v)).
Presence sensing devices must only be used for normal production
operations. Operations that involve full revolution mechanical
power presses; mechanical power presses configured so that
a person could enter, pass through, and become clear of the
sensing field; and die-setting and maintenance procedures must
not be done in the presence sensing device initiation (PSDI) mode
(§1910.217(h)).
Machines using full revolution clutches must incorporate a singlestroke mechanism. If the single-stroke mechanism is dependent
upon spring action, the spring(s) must be of the compression type,
operating on a rod or guided within a hole or tube, and designed
to prevent interleaving of the spring coils in event of breakage
(§§1910.217(b)(3)(i) and (ii)).
A main disconnect switch capable of being locked in the OFF
position must be provided with every power press control system
(§1910.217(b)(8)(i)).
To ensure safe operating conditions and to maintain a record of
inspections and maintenance work, the employer must establish
a program of periodic and regular inspections of power presses
to ensure the safe operating condition and adjustment of all their
parts, auxiliary equipment, and safeguards. The employer must
maintain a certification record of inspections that includes the
date of inspection, the signature of the person who performed the
inspection, and the serial number, or other identifier, of the power
press that was inspected (§1910.217(e)(1)(i)).

their height to some fixed part of machinery or building structure.
Where a guard is exposed to contact with moving equipment,
additional strength may be necessary (§1910.219(o)(1)(i)(a)).
Wood guards may be used in the woodworking and chemical
industries, in industries where the presence of fumes or where
manufacturing conditions would cause the rapid deterioration of
metal guards. Also, wood guards may be used in construction work
and in locations outdoors, where extreme cold or extreme heat
make metal guards and railings undesirable. In all other industries,
wood guards must not be used (§1910.219(o)(2)(i)).
All guards for inclined belts must be arranged in such a manner
that a minimum clearance of 7 feet (2.1 meters) is maintained
between the belt and the floor at any point outside the guard

above the floor or platform must be guarded with an enclosure of
sheet, perforated, or expanded metal or woven wire (§§1910.219(b)
(1) and (b)(1)(i)).
Flywheels protruding through a working floor must be entirely
enclosed or surrounded by a guardrail and toeboard (§1910.219(b)
(1)(iii)).
Where both runs of horizontal belts are 7 feet (2.1 meters) or less
from the floor level, the guard must extend to at least 15 inches (37.5
centimeters) above the belt or to a standard height, except that where
both runs of a horizontal belt are 42 inches (1.05 meters) or less from
the floor, the belt must be fully enclosed (§1910.219(e)(1)(i)).
Gears, sprocket wheels, and chains must be guarded, unless they
are more than 7 feet (2.1 meters) above the floor, or unless the
mesh points are guarded. This requirement does not apply to
manually operated sprockets (§§1910.219(f)(1) through (3)).
Couplings with bolts, nuts, or set screws extending beyond the flange
of the coupling must be guarded by a safety sleeve (§1910.219(i)(2)).

Powered Platforms for Building Maintenance
All completed building maintenance equipment installations must
be inspected and tested in the field before being placed in service.
A similar inspection and test must be made following any major
alteration to an existing installation. No hoist must be subjected to
a load in excess of 125 percent of its rated load (§1910.66(g)(1)).
Structural supports, tie-downs, tie-in guides, anchoring devices,
and any affected parts of a building included in the installation must
be designed by or under the direction of a registered, professional
engineer experienced in such design. Exterior installations must be
capable of withstanding prevailing climatic conditions. The building
installation must provide safe access to, and egress from, the

provide primary support for the suspended equipment must not
affect the capability of the building to meet OSHA requirements
(§1910.66(e)(10)).
The equipment power circuit must be an independent electrical
circuit that must remain separate from all other equipment within or
on the building, other than power circuits used for hand tools that
will be used in conjunction with the equipment. If the building is
provided with an emergency power system, the equipment power
circuit may also be connected to this system (§1910.66(e)(11)(iii)).
Equipment installations must be designed by or under the direction
of a registered professional engineer that is experienced in such
design. The design must provide for a minimum live load of 250
pounds (113.6 kg.) for each occupant of a suspended or supported
platform. Equipment that is exposed to wind when not in service
must be designed to withstand forces generated by winds of at least
100 mph (44.7 m/s) at 30 feet (9.2 meters) above grade and when in
service able to withstand forces generated by winds of at least 50

Woodworking Machinery
All woodworking machinery – such as table saws, swing saws,
radial saws, band saws, jointers, tenoning machines, boring and
mortising machines, shapers, planers, lathes, sanders, veneer
cutters, and other miscellaneous woodworking machinery – must
be enclosed or guarded, except that part of the blade doing the
actual cutting, to protect the operator and other employees from
hazards inherent to the operation (§§1910.213(c) through (r)).
Power control devices must be provided on each machine to make
it possible for the operator to cut off the power to the machine
without leaving his/her position at the point of operation. Power
controls and operating controls should be located within easy
reach of the operator while at his/her regular work location, making
it unnecessary for the operator to reach over the cutter to make
adjustments. This does not apply to constant pressure controls used
only for setup purposes (§§1910.213(b)(1) and (b)(4)).
Restarts
In operations where injury to the operator might result if motors
were to restart after power failures, provision must be made to
prevent machines from automatically restarting upon restoration of

upper half of the saw blade. The sides of the lower exposed portion
of the blade must be guarded by a device that will automatically
adjust to the thickness of and remain in contact with the material
being cut (§1910.213(h)(1)).
Radial saws used for ripping must have non-kickback fingers or
dogs (§1910.213(h)(2)).
Radial saws must have an adjustable stop to prevent the forward
travel of the blade beyond the position necessary to complete the
cut in repetitive operations (§1910.213(h)(3)).
Radial saws must be installed so that the cutting head will return to
the starting position when released by the operator (§1910.213(h)(4)).
Self-feed Circular Saws
Self-feed circular saws, feed rolls and blades must be protected by
a hood or guard to prevent the hand of the operator from coming
into contact with the in-running rolls at any point (§1910.213(f)(1)).
Swing or Sliding Cut-off Saws
Swing or sliding cut-off saws must be provided with a hood that
will completely enclose the upper half of the saw (§1910.213(g)(1)).
GENERAL INDUSTRY DIGEST • 85

Swing or sliding cut-off saws must be provided with limit stops to

safety guards with the following exceptions:
•

Wheels used for internal work while within the work being
ground (§1910.215(a)(1)(i) and §1910.243(c)(1)(i)(a));

•

Mounted wheels, used in portable operations, 2 inches (5
centimeters) and smaller in diameter (§1910.215(a)(1)(ii) and
§1910.243(c)(1)(i)(b)); and

•

Type 16, 17, 18, 18R, and 19 cones, plugs, and threaded hole pot
balls where the work offers protection (§1910.215(a)(1)(iii) and
§1910.243(c)(1)(i)(c)).

Abrasive wheel safety guards must cover the spindle end, nut, and
flange projections. Safety guards must also be mounted so as to
maintain proper alignment with the wheel, and the strength of the
fastenings must exceed the strength of the guard, except:
•

Safety guards on all operations where the work provides a
suitable measure of protection to the operator may be so
constructed that the spindle end, nut, and outer flange are
exposed (§1910.215(a)(2)(i) and §1910.243(c)(1)(ii)(b));

86 • OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION

•

Where the nature of the work is such as to entirely cover the
side of the wheel, the side covers of the guard may be omitted
(§1910.215(a)(2)(i) and §1910.243(c)(1)(ii)(b)); and

•

The spindle end, nut, and outer flange may be exposed on
portable machines designed as portable saws, as well as on
other machines designed for, and used with, type 6, 11, 27, and
28 abrasive wheels, cutting off wheels, and tuck pointing wheels
(§1910.215(a)(2)(ii) and §1910.243(c)(1)(ii)(c)).

Work rests on offhand grinding machines must be used to support
the work. They must be of rigid construction and designed to be
adjustable to compensate for wheel wear. Work rests must also
be kept adjusted closely to the wheel with no more than a 1/8 inch
(3.2 millimeters) opening. This will prevent the work from being
jammed between the wheel and the rest, which may cause wheel
breakage. Further, during any wheel adjustments the wheel must
be motionless and wheel rests must be securely clamped after each
adjustment (§1910.215(a)(4)).
Abrasive wheel safety guards for bench and floor stands and for
cylindrical grinders must not expose the grinding wheel periphery
for more than 90 degrees or ¼ of the periphery (bench and floor
stands) and 180 degrees (cylindrical grinders). The exposure must
begin at a point not more than 65 degrees above the horizontal
plane of the wheel spindle. The protecting member must be
adjustable for variations in wheel size so that the distance between
the wheel periphery and adjustable tongue (tongue guard) or end
of the peripheral member at the top must never exceed ¼ inch (6
millimeters) (§§1910.215(b)(3) through (4), and (b)(9)).
Machines designed for a fixed location must be securely anchored
to prevent “walking,” or designed in such a manner that prevents
movement (§1910.212(b)).

Grain Handling Facilities
Entry into Grain Bins
Workers should not enter a grain storage bin unless it is absolutely
necessary. If a worker enters a grain storage bin, employers must
implement the following hazard control measures:
GENERAL INDUSTRY DIGEST • 87

•

De-energize and disconnect, lockout and tag, or block off all
mechanical, electrical, hydraulic and pneumatic equipment that
presents a danger (§1910.272(g)(1)(ii)).

•

Prohibit workers from walking down grain and similar practices
where walking on grain is intended to make it flow (§1910.272(g)
(1)(iv)).

•

Prohibit and prevent worker entry below a bridging condition, or
where grain is built up on the side of the bin (§1910.272(g)(6)).

•

Train workers at least annually and when changes in job
assignment will expose workers to new hazards (§1910.272(e)).

•

Provide each worker who enters a grain structure and who may
be exposed to an engulfment hazard, with a body harness or
boatswain’s chair. The body harness must have a lifeline that is
positioned and is of sufficient length to prevent a worker from
sinking further than waist-deep in grain (§1910.272(g)(2)).

•

Provide workers with rescue equipment, such as winch systems,
that are specifically suited for bin rescue (§1910.272(g)(4)).

•

Station an observer who is equipped to provide assistance and
perform rescue operations outside the bin (§1910.272(g)(3)).

•

Ensure that communications (visual, voice or signal line) are
maintained between the observer and the workers who entered
the bin (§1910.272(g)(3)).

•

Test the air within a bin for oxygen content and the presence of
hazardous gases (when there is a reason to believe they may be
present) before entry (§1910.272(g)(1)(iii)).

•

Provide and continue ventilation until any unsafe atmospheric
conditions are eliminated. If toxicity or oxygen deficiency
cannot be eliminated, workers must be provided with and wear
appropriate respirators (§1910.272(g)(1)(iii)(A) and (B)).

•

Issue a permit each time a worker enters a bin, unless the
employer is present during the entire entry operation. The permit
must certify that the precautions contained in §1910.272(g) have
been implemented before workers enter the bin (§1910.272(g)(1)
(i)).

General Electrical Safety
Electrical equipment must be free from recognized hazards that
are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to employees.
Safety of equipment must be determined using the following
considerations: (1) suitability for installation and use in conformity;
(2) mechanical strength and durability, including parts designed
to enclose and protect other equipment; (3) wire-bending and
connection space; (4) electrical insulation; (5) heating and arcing
effects when in use; (6) classification by type, size, voltage, current
capacity, and specific use; and (7) any other factors that contribute
to the practical safeguarding of persons using or likely to come into
contact with the equipment (§§1910.303(b)(1)(i) through (viii)).
Electrical equipment and installations, including building electrical
system components, and tools that use electrical power, that
have been inspected and found by a nationally recognized testing
laboratory to conform to specified plans or to procedures of
applicable codes are deemed “accepted.” They are, in addition,
deemed “acceptable” to the Assistant Secretary of Labor
(§1910.399).
If no nationally recognized testing laboratory accepts, certifies, lists,
labels, or determines the electrical equipment or its installation
safe, another federal agency, state, municipal, or other local
authority responsible for enforcing occupational safety provisions
of the National Electrical Code may perform the inspection. If
such equipment and its installation are found to be in compliance
with the provisions of the National Electrical Code, they will be
determined “acceptable” to the Assistant Secretary of Labor
(§1910.399).
Custom-made equipment or related installations that are designed,
fabricated for, and intended for the use by a particular customer
may be deemed “acceptable” as long as they are determined to
be safe for their intended use by their manufacturer on the basis
of test data. This test data must be kept and made available by the
employer (§1910.399).

92 • OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION

Flexible Cords and Cables (Extension Cords)
Flexible cords and cables must be protected from accidental

devices if the system is separately derived (§1910.304(g)(4)(i)).
For an ungrounded service-supplied system, the equipment
grounding conductor must be connected to the grounding
electrode conductor at the service equipment. For an ungrounded
separately derived system, the equipment grounding conductor
must be connected to the grounding electrode conductor at, or
ahead of, the system disconnecting means or overcurrent devices
(§1910.304(g)(4)(ii)).
The path to ground from circuits, equipment, and enclosures must
be permanent and continuous, and effective (§1910.304(g)(5)).

Examination
Electrical equipment must be free from recognized hazards that
are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to employees
(§1910.303(b)(1)).

GENERAL INDUSTRY DIGEST • 93

Guarding
Except as elsewhere required or permitted by 29 CFR 1910, subpart
S, live parts of electric equipment operating at 50 volts or more
shall be guarded against accidental contact by use of approved
cabinets or other forms of approved enclosures or by any of the
approved means (§1910.303(g)(2)).

Identification
Each disconnecting means, required by 29 CFR 1910, subpart S,
for motors and appliances must be legibly marked to indicate its
purpose, unless it is located and arranged so the purpose is evident
(§1910.303(f)(1)).

Listing and Labeling
Listed or labeled equipment must be used or installed in accord with
any instructions included in the listing or labeling (§1910.303(b)(2)).

Electrical Openings
Unused openings in electrical cabinets, boxes, and fittings must be
effectively closed (§1910.305(b)(1)(i)).

Safety-Related Work Practices
Safety-related work practices must be employed to prevent electric
shock or other injuries resulting from either direct or indirect
electrical contacts, when work is performed near or on equipment
or circuits that are or may be energized (§1910.333(a)).
Electrical safety-related work practices cover both qualified persons
(those who have training in avoiding the electrical hazards of
working on or near exposed energized parts) and unqualified
persons (those with little or no such training) (§1910.331(a)).

94 • OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION

Live parts that an employee may be exposed to must be
deenergized before the employee works on or near them, unless
the employer can demonstrate that deenergizing introduces
additional or increased hazards or it is infeasible due to equipment
design or operational limitations (§1910.333(a)(1)).
Employers must develop and implement written lockout and/or
tagout procedures that must be maintained and made available for
inspection. (§§1910.333(b)(2) and (b)(2)(i)).
Overhead power lines must be deenergized and grounded by
the owner or operator of the lines or other protective measures
must be provided before work performed near them is started.
Protective measures, such as guarding or insulating the lines,
must be designed to prevent employees from contacting the lines
(§1910.333(c)(3)).
Unqualified employees and mechanical equipment must be at
least 10 feet (305 centimeters) away from overhead power lines. If
the voltage to ground exceeds 50,000 volts (50kV), the minimum
clearance distance should be increased by 4 inches (10 centimeters)
for each additional 10,000 volts (10kV) (§1910.333(c)(3)(i)(A)).
OSHA requires portable ladders to have nonconductive side rails
if used by employees who would be working where they might
contact exposed energized circuit parts (§1910.333(c)(7)).

Splices
Conductors must be spliced or joined with splicing devices
identified for such use or by brazing, welding, or soldering with a
fusible alloy or metal. All splices, joints, and free ends of conductors
must be covered with an insulation equivalent to that of the
conductor or with an insulating device suitable for the purpose
(§1910.303(c)(3)(i)).

Hazardous Workplace Complaints:
Worker Rights
Workers have the right to a safe workplace. The Occupational Safety
and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act) was passed to prevent workers
from being killed or seriously harmed at work. The law requires
employers to provide their employees with working conditions that
are free of known dangers. Workers may file a complaint to have
OSHA inspect their workplace if they believe that their employer
is not following OSHA standards or that there are serious hazards.
Further, the OSH Act gives complainants the right to request that
their names not be revealed to their employers. It is also against the
law for an employer to fire, demote, transfer, or retaliate in any way
against a worker for filing a complaint or using other OSHA rights.
If a workplace has unsafe or unhealthful working conditions,
workers may want to file a complaint. Often the best and fastest
way to get a hazard corrected is to notify a supervisor or employer.
Workers or their representatives may file a complaint online or by
phone, mail, email or fax with the nearest OSHA office and request
an inspection. A worker may also ask OSHA not to reveal his or her
name. To file a complaint, call 1-800-321-OSHA (6742) or contact the
nearest OSHA regional, area, state plan, or consultation office listed
at www.osha.gov. The teletypewriter (TTY) number is (877) 889-5627.
Written, signed complaints submitted to OSHA area offices are
more likely to result in an on-site OSHA inspection. Most online or
unsigned complaints are resolved informally over the phone with
the employer. Complaints from workers in states with an OSHAapproved state plan will be forwarded to the appropriate state plan
for response.
Workers can call 1-800-321-OSHA (6742) to request a complaint
form from their local OSHA office or visit www.osha.gov/pls/osha7/
eComplaintForm.html to submit the form online. Completed forms
can be faxed or mailed to the local OSHA office (provided at the end
of this guide). Include your name, address and telephone number
so that OSHA can contact you.

OSHA Assistance, Services and Programs
OSHA has a great deal of information to assist employers in
complying with their responsibilities under OSHA law. Several
OSHA programs and services can help employers identify and
correct job hazards, as well as improve their injury and illness
prevention program.

Establishing an Injury and Illness
Prevention Program
The key to a safe and healthful work environment is a
comprehensive injury and illness prevention program.
Injury and illness prevention programs are systems that can
substantially reduce the number and severity of workplace injuries
and illnesses, while reducing costs to employers. Thousands of
employers across the United States already manage safety using
injury and illness prevention programs, and OSHA believes that
all employers can and should do the same. Thirty-four states have
requirements or voluntary guidelines for workplace injury and
illness prevention programs. Most successful injury and illness
prevention programs are based on a common set of key elements.
These include management leadership, worker participation,
hazard identification, hazard prevention and control, education and
training, and program evaluation and improvement. Visit OSHA’s
Injury and Illness Prevention Programs web page at www.osha.gov/
dsg/topics/safetyhealth for more information.

Compliance Assistance Specialists
OSHA has compliance assistance specialists throughout the nation
located in most OSHA offices. Compliance assistance specialists
can provide information to employers and workers about OSHA
standards, short educational programs on specific hazards or
OSHA rights and responsibilities, and information on additional
compliance assistance resources. For more details, visit www.osha.
gov/dcsp/compliance_assistance/cas.html or call 1-800-321-OSHA
(6742) to contact your local OSHA office.

Free On-site Safety and Health Consultation
Services for Small Business
OSHA’s On-site Consultation Program offers free and confidential
advice to small and medium-sized businesses in all states across
the country, with priority given to high-hazard worksites. Each
year, responding to requests from small employers looking to
create or improve their safety and health management programs,
OSHA’s On-site Consultation Program conducts over 29,000 visits
to small business worksites covering over 1.5 million workers
across the nation.
On-site consultation services are separate from enforcement and do
not result in penalties or citations. Consultants from state agencies
or universities work with employers to identify workplace hazards,
provide advice on compliance with OSHA standards, and assist in
establishing safety and health management programs.
For more information, to find the local On-site Consultation office in
your state, or to request a brochure on consultation services, visit
www.‌osha.gov/consultation, or call 1-800-321-OSHA (6742).
Under the consultation program, certain exemplary employers may
request participation in OSHA’s Safety and Health Achievement
Recognition Program (SHARP). Eligibility for participation includes,
but is not limited to, receiving a full-service, comprehensive
consultation visit, correcting all identified hazards and developing
an effective safety and health management program. Worksites
that receive SHARP recognition are exempt from programmed
inspections during the period that the SHARP certification is valid.

Cooperative Programs
OSHA offers cooperative programs under which businesses,
labor groups and other organizations can work cooperatively with
OSHA. To find out more about the programs, visit www.osha.gov/
cooperativeprograms.

OSHA Advisory Committees
OSHA sponsors advisory committees to advise the Secretary of
Labor and the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety
and Health on workplace safety and health issues.
All of OSHA’s advisory committees have membership balanced
between representatives of workers and employers, and most also
include other qualified individuals such as government officials,
safety and health professionals and members of the public. All
committees accept comments from interested individuals.
Transcripts and minutes of the meetings are also available to
the public on the committee web pages at www.osha.gov/oshaadvisory-committee.html.
The five current advisory committees are:
•

The National Advisory Committee on Occupational Safety and
Health (NACOSH), which advises, consults with and makes
recommendations to the U.S. Secretaries of Labor and Health
and Human Services (HHS) on matters regarding the OSH Act;

•

The Advisory Committee on Construction Safety and Health
(ACCSH), which advises the Secretary of Labor on construction
safety and health standards and other matters;

•

The Federal Advisory Council on Occupational Safety and Health
(FACOSH), which advises the Secretary of Labor on all aspects of
federal agency safety and health; and

•

The Maritime Advisory Committee for Occupational Safety and
Health (MACOSH), which advises the Secretary of Labor on
workplace safety and health programs, policies and standards in
the maritime industry.

•

The Whistleblower Protection Advisory Committee (WPAC),
which advises, consults with and makes recommendations
to the Secretary of Labor on ways to improve the fairness,
efficiency, effectiveness, and transparency of OSHA’s
administration of whistleblower protections.

In addition, OSHA may form short-term advisory committees to
advise the agency on specific issues.

NIOSH Health Hazard Evaluation Program
Getting Help with Health Hazards
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)
is a federal agency that conducts scientific and medical research
on workers’ safety and health. At no cost to employers or workers,
NIOSH can help identify health hazards and recommend ways to
reduce or eliminate those hazards in the workplace through its
Health Hazard Evaluation (HHE) Program.
Workers, union representatives and employers can request a
NIOSH HHE. An HHE is often requested when there is a higher than
expected rate of a disease or injury in a group of workers. These
situations may be the result of an unknown cause, a new hazard, or
a mixture of sources. To request a NIOSH Health Hazard Evaluation
go to www.cdc.gov/niosh/hhe/request.html. To find out more, in
English or Spanish, about the Health Hazard Evaluation Program:
E-mail HHERequestHelp@cdc.gov or call 800-CDC-INFO
(800-232-4636).
